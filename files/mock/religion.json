              "PSYCHORELIGIOUS DIMENSIONS ON THERAPY PERSPECTIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nThis paper examines the psychoreligious dimensions in a therapy perspective, which can be performed on people affected and those who are not affected by the 2019 corona virus (Covid-19), because pandemic situations often cause social chaos, and are often even discovered from religious thought and the socio-religious community. The kind of research in this paper is library research, using a qualitative-philosophical approach. The data were analyzed by using the Religious Cognitive Emotional Theory (RCET). This study found; first, physical healing efforts require realistic religious thinking to explain that the purpose and meaning of their life is very important, and keeping the body healthy is the most important teaching of religion. Second, the therapy process can be carried out by the therapists by directing clients into three main dimensions: psychoreligious, cognitive-religious, and spiritual-religious. The findings in this study contribute to increasing the treasures of thought in therapy disciplines in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has really caused public anxiety, not only because this virus has killed thousands of lives, both throughout the world and Indonesia(A. Z. . Also, because religion is part of the emergence cause of social problems. For example, recent research from the Pew Research Center shows that people who are atheists are more likely to accept Covid-19 vaccination projects than religious groups who tend to refuse (Fundrika, 2021).\nThe emergence of rejection from religious groups is what worries public the most. Contradictory discourses caused the situation to escalate. This religious environment does not only occur abroad, but also in Indonesia, which is predominantly Muslim. Therefore, the Indonesian Ulema Council is also concerned about the actual development, which sees the large number of people's rejection of vaccines (Ribunnews, 2021).\nThe government has tried to invite religious leaders and religious organizations to succeed in preventing the pandemic transmission program. However, there are some groups who fail to be invited to cooperate with the government. In fact, the takmir of the mosque in Bekasi had expelled men who were praying by wearing masks and obeying the health protocols recommended by the government.(A. Z. Sarnoto & Hayatina, 2021) The Covid-19 pandemic is considered not merely a public health issue, but has expanded to become a political science discipline and a globalist struggle for business interests. Not surprisingly, in the process of handling it, the government must involve the State Intelligence Agency (BIN) to investigate the issue of this pandemic. BIN participates in doing things that should be done by the Ministry of Health. (Detiknews, 2020) Because after all, Covid-19 has been described as a public health problem from the beginning, not a problem of state security and sovereignty (Perry et al., 2020).\nThis increasingly complex issue has given rise to a socio-political situation that has changed the status of Covid-19 from merely a public health issue to a political one (Bakry et al., 2020). On the other hand, it impacts the efforts of therapists, who work in serving their clients. Therapists are required to be able to explain to their clients about the problem of the corona virus, in the midst of a socio-political atmosphere that is increasingly complicated, not conducive, unordinary, and is very multidimensional (Abbas et al., 2021).\nTherapists need multidisciplinary approaches, when dealing with clients, including explaining the most important religious and psycho-religious dimensions in the therapy process (Kelley et al., 2021). These religious and psychological-religious dimensions are actually in accordance with the modern medical paradigm. For example, a Muslim/Muslimah who wants to perform mahdhah worship, such as praying and congregational Friday, is required to maintain cleanliness and purity of inner and outer (Bahammam, 2015). This is in accordance with the mandate of health protocols (prokes) during the pandemic, such as maintaining distance, wearing masks, preventing direct contacts of affected people. Everything aims to maintain health. (Chu et al., 2020) In this way, Islamic thought, both religious and psycho-religious dimensions, will be rational-realistic in a therapeutic perspective.\n\nRESEARCH METHODS\nThe type of research in this paper is a literature research. Literature research is basically a technique of data collection carried out by studying and understanding data, which is closely related to research problems. These data were taken from books, theories, records, and documents (George, 2008). From this research, the data collected during the research process shows a new form of religious and psycho-religious dimensions. This new phenomenon arises because of the tense social situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, media and scientific articles show the efforts of Muslims and Ulama to present the realistic side of Islamic teachings, especially in dealing with the corona virus wisely.\nThe process of collecting research data is carried out by using a philosophical approach and analyzed qualitatively. The philosophical approach is the search for wisdom values and fundamental principles of knowledge. The philosophical approach is the first step in the journey through various cognitive disciplines. Therefore, researchers are free to evaluate and contribute to other disciplines, in a way that researchers with non-philosophical approaches cannot (Williamson, 2020). There are many disciplines used here, which can be summarized in the framework of a philosophical approach, such as aspects of religious law, spirituality, psychology, social behavior, morality and the discipline of therapy itself. These various disciplines seem to have a causal relationship that cannot be separated in this philosophical approach.\nThe data collected because of the initial indication has important value for research, then, it is analyzed using the Religious Cognitive Emotional Therapy (RCET) theory. According to Ali Reza Rajaei, RCET is a therapy theory that relies on the client's cognitive experience and religious beliefs. So, a therapist touching the dimensions of the client's religious psychology, and directs it from the inside (Rajaei, 2010). Even the therapist's directions in the view of the client will appear more realistic, commonsense, and easy to understand even by the client's own simple level understanding (Syafitri & Rahmah, 2021).\nWith this RCET, according to Dimitrios Kapogiannis, et al., therapists can use it as an integrative cognitive neuroscience framework, which the therapist is able to understand the cognitive and neural underpinnings of the client's beliefs. For Dimitrios Kapogiannis, there are at least three psychological dimensions of religious belief (psycho-religious) that are important to observe: the level of involvement of God felt by the client, the emotions felt when together with God, and religious knowledge that is doctrinal and experiential. While, at the cognitive level, important aspects that the therapist needs to observe in the client are around intentions and emotions, abstract semantics, and constructed images. All these specific components of religious beliefs, according to Dimitrios, et al., are mediated by brain networks, which underlie religious beliefs in cognitive function (Kapogiannis et al., 2009).\nWhen the researcher began to examine the psychological and religious cognitive aspects of the research subjects, it was found that the data contained religious arguments directed at providing scientific rational beliefs based on secular religious and medical beliefs. In addition, such discourses are constructed to strengthen the people's choice in carrying out their religion according to the correct procedures in the pandemic era. The combination of religious and medical arguments makes the public more confident and has no reason to have different views (İşbilen & Mehmedoğlu, 2022) . It is at this point that the therapy discipline becomes responsible for dealing with the three human dimensions; psychology, cognition, and ethical morals, aided by religious and psychoreligious studies.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION Islamic Realism in the Therapy Process\nReligious and psychoreligious dimensions in a therapeutic perspective are two very realistic Islamic dimensions. Islamic realism is one of the critical thoughts on Islamic thought, one of which was formulated by Matthew LN Wilkinson. Contemporary Islamic Philosophy articles help Muslims overcome the challenges of postmodernity and overcome the barriers they face in interacting and relating to non-Muslims. Wilkinson argues that the philosophy of Islamic critical realism is very suitable for providing a theoretical view of contemporary religious studies, clarifying and deepening the concepts of Islamic doctrine and practice (Wilkinson, 2013).\nIslamic realism in this therapeutic activity can be grouped into three periods; pre-therapy, during therapy, and post-therapy. In the pre-therapy period, the client must be identified first, whether including having a psychological condition filled with doubts about the halalness of the vaccine as an imported product or doubts about the postvaccination impact. If the client belongs to the first category who has doubts about the halalness of the vaccine, then the therapist can use reasons that have been justified by Ulama or religious institutions, such as MUI because, MUI has mentioned the halalness of vaccines (MUI, 2021a).\nAll the religious arguments of authoritative Ulama can be used by the therapist to dispel client doubts. One of the religious arguments that can be used by therapists is the result of the plenary meeting of the Central MUI Fatwa Commission, which in the end dared to stipulate the Covid-19 Vaccine produced by Sinovac as an item with Halal and Holy status. Chairman of the MUI for Fatwa KH. Asrorun Niam Sholeh said, \"Regarding the halal aspect, after a long discussion with the auditor's explanation, the Fatwa Commission meeting agreed that the Covid-19 vaccine produced by Sinovac Lifescience Co for which certification was submitted by Biofarma is pure and halal\" (MUI, 2021b).\n\nDimensions Psycho-religious\nTheoretically, psycho-religious is a concept of psychology that contains religious values. If the case is Islam, it means that Islamic values are the main basis in understanding the human psyche (A. Z. Sarnoto & Alhan, 2013). So that Islamic psychology is understood as a science that talks about humans and their personalities based on formal Islamic sources (al-Quran and Hadith), reason, senses, and intuition (Yudiani, 2013).\nOn the other hand, Minister of Religion Yaqut Cholil Qoumas said that in the teachings of Islam, there is such thing as the law of obedience. Be obedient to Allah SWT, obedient to the Apostle, obedient to Ulil Amri or government (Tribunnews, 2021). For this reason, during the monitoring period for clients, therapists are required to be able to explain the client's religious duties, specifically in the form of their obligations to the government, including vaccination programs, adherence to health protocols, and other government policies that lead to preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\nIn the discipline of general psychology, this obedience is a matter of compliance. Regarding compliance, there are several reasons why the public is not entitled to accept the government (Arief et al., 2021). Health social psychology explains that people's non-compliance with health protocols mostly occurs because of their lack of understanding of the dangers of disease and the benefits of treatment and the large obstacles in access to health (Kompas, 2020). The therapist has a big contribution here, in explaining the dangers of covid-19 and the benefits of handling it to clients (A. . By providing a more rational explanation through a religious approach, the therapist can go further into the client's dimension of consciousness, namely cognitive-religious (Baykal, 2021). When discussing the cognitive-religious aspects in the perspective of Islam, the therapist must be able to show the rationality of each Islamic teaching to the client (Faraz et al., 2022). The practice of therapy in a time of pandemic which is full of chaos, be it social, political, or even in scientific narratives, because many of the opposing parties are medical professionals, making the practice of therapy is increasingly difficult to carry out, and therapists face more and more obstacles in their work in dealing with their clients (Mastura et al., 2020 Apart from medical personnel and doctors who confuse the public, rejection of vaccines also comes from scientists. The survey results show that the majority of those who refuse the Covid-19 vaccine have a fairly high education. The data were presented by the Ministry of Health (Kemenkes). The Ministry of Health explained that there are still 33 percent of Indonesians who refuse and are not sure about the Covid-19 vaccine. Spokesperson for the Covid-19 Vaccination of the Ministry of Health, Siti Nadia Tarmizi, said that the percentage of Indonesian people who were initially believed to be able to prevent transmission through vaccines was 67 percent (TribunJateng, 2021).\nIt is a tough job for therapists when dealing with clients who understand the results of a survey conducted by the Indonesian Ministry of Health's Balitbangkes April-May 2021. Because it is public information that 33 percent of the public are not convinced, and even refuse vaccination. Moreover, the survey results show that almost 99 percent of respondents already know about Covid-19 vaccination information from various mass media. However, around 7.6 percent of respondents refused the vaccine for various reasons. Not to mention the survey conducted at the education level, showing that respondents from higher education are the group of people who refuse vaccination the most. Nadia explained, the percentage figure of 18.6 percent came from the D-4 and S-1 education groups (TribunJateng, 2021). Therapists who deal with this kind of client are required to work extra hard.\nSocio-political chaos, even medical narratives, challenged the therapists in using religion as an important instrument of their therapeutic processes and procedures. Therefore, Islam must be presented as a rational teaching, capable of reasoning in a healthy manner, especially in the midst of the unusual COVID-19 pandemic (Syafitri & Rahmah, 2021). Muhammad Irfan said that one of the role models of academics was Harun Nasution , who was widely known by Indonesian intelligentsia as a scientist who was diligent in studying various fields of Islamic studies, such as the science of kalam, philosophy, and Sufism. One of the contributions of Harun Nasution's thought is the introduction of a new approach in Islamic studies, namely. a philosophical approach with an emphasis on ratio or rationalism (reason), or better known as Rational Islam (Irfan, 2018).\nBy relying on the Rational Islam of Harun Nasution, for example, the therapists can deal with client problems, especially those of Indonesian culture. In the midst of issues of disharmony, violence and even conflict, in the name of religion, then Harun Nasution's rational Islamic thought can be used by therapists in communicating with clients at the beginning of the diagnosis, during the therapist's process, even after therapy is done. Rational Islam is not only a solution in understanding religious phenomena that can create religious harmony, but also Rational Islamic thinking can place religion more proportionally for example, when the government emphasizes on the implementation of strict health protocols, Islam is here to provide a religious explanation. That he hopes, clients are influenced to think more rationally, practice a rational religion, especially when the pandemic situation leads to a conflict of interest (Perry et al., 2020).\nIn turn, the most important thing for therapists in dealing with clients is by approaching their psychological-religious side to create inner comfort that is supported by rational arguments, both coming from authoritative scholars in their fields, paramedics who qualified, as well as other rational reasons that are considered capable of touching the client's inner dimension (Durmuş & Durar, 2022). On the other hand, the religious and psycho-religious dimensions must also be presented as rational dimensions, because only then can these therapists communicate more healthily with their clients (Yavuz, 2022). Furthermore, irrational religiosity and psycho-religion are much more prone to creating social chaos or chaos in society. This has happened when the public's rejection of health protocols and vaccination programs was carried out and campaigned by scientists, medical personnel, and even religious leaders themselves (Anwar, 2010).\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe psychoreligious dimensions of the client in the presence of the therapist are important dimensions as a work discipline. Therapy carried out by therapists on clients is not effective unless it is able to be carried out optimally with the religious and psychological dimensions. While in practical practice, a therapist can classify clients into three important periods; pre-therapy, during the therapy process, and post-therapy.\nIn these three periods, the intensity of the relationship between therapist and client must be maintained properly. In the second period (during the therapy process) there are three dimensions that must be trained, the psycho-religious dimension, the cognitivereligious dimension, and the religious-moralspiritual dimension. These three dimensions must be handled by the therapist by presenting Islamic rational values. That way, the client will receive the therapist's directions more rationally and realistically, as well as more contextually.\nContextuality that can be understood more rationally and realistically by therapists and clients is a phenomenon of the corona virus pandemic . The pandemic era is the most fundamental independent variable, because it affects changes in social behavior, which also in turn affects religious beliefs or knowledge. With changes in beliefs and knowledge, social behavior also changes. This kind of fundamental change becomes the context for the therapist to build his discourse as well as a realistic reference for the client in receiving the therapist's direction. Therefore, all the theoretical conceptual buildings suggested by the therapist to the client as well as the therapy procedures that the client himself must obey or follow, all of which refer to the changing social reality due to the pandemic."

              "A Study of Relativistic Theory of Ethics in the Light of Islamic Theory of Morality\n\nEvery civilization has a system of ethics that defines their values and morality. The basic concepts of \"Good\" and \"Evil\" are also derived from that system. This system of ethics gains its inspiration from the world view of that particular civilization. Islam, like all other religions, also give a complete moral code for its believers. Qur’ān and the Sunnah here is the only criterion for determining the basic principles of the Ethics of Islam and hence morality in Islam is objective as well as absolute. In the post-modern world however, the morality and value system that got endorsed by Postmodernist thinkers is relative and subjective instead of absolute and objective. Morality here is largely considered as relative as well as subjective and hence vary with change in time and space. It can also undergo through evolution and no act or concept can be judged here on some absolute criterion. This “Relativism” and “Subjectivism” potentially challenge all the traditional schools of ethics. This paper would study whether this relativistic theory of ethics have any compatibility with Islamic fundamentals regarding ethics. This research paper is based on descriptive method along with primordial focus on Moral Relativism.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIt is self-evident that Islam is absolute in its values; and Qur'ān and the Sunnah are considered as the ultimate and absolute criteria for determining right and wrong. Furthermore, they provide a balance for all kind of judgements including moral judgments. From Islamic viewpoint man is a spiritual and moral agent and the sole purpose of his creation is to worship Allah who is his Lord and creator. The divine guidance given by Allah is pathway for man that would lead him to success; and deviating from this path would result in grave consequences in hereafter. Sharī'ah is a set of dos' and don'ts that are inferred from the Holy Qur'ān and the Sunnah and it covers all the aspects of human life. These basic teachings of Islam form the value system that is valid and relevant to all the societies and for all the ages. It also provides the perspective that laid the foundations of forming Islamic civilization.\nThe ethics of Islam are part of a larger whole and is strongly connected with beliefs of Islam. The moral values in Islam are seen as a manifestation of one's Imān and his spiritual self. For example, Haya is an important moral attribute, it is said by the Holy Prophet that \"Haya is part of faith.\" 1 As morality and faith appear to be linked here, the importance of the relationship of faith and morality can also be seen in the statement by the Prophet (PBUH) that \"The best of believers are those whose morals are good.\" It is said in Qur'ān that prayer prevents the acts of indecency; the fast shields; and the fasting person is advised to abstain from obscenity. Fasting and Pilgrimage are although part of the system of worship, but it is evident that how strongly they are linked to morality. The distinguishing feature of this system is that it is absolute and beyond the change of time and space. Moreover, it is pathway that ensures success in this world and in the world hereafter. It is also seen as a practical way for living peacefully in a way that everyone's rights are fully protected.\nThe Western world, however, have gone through enormous changes in the past centuries and that brought about a complete metamorphosis of moral concepts. So, the morality is seen as a phenomenon that should be determined on the basis of reason and the authority of religion in determining moral judgments is completely rejected. The debates of existentialism and freedom resulted in subjective approach towards morality while post-modern philosophy emphasized relativism. The theory of Moral Relativism is a paradigm of morality in the western world that declares morality as a personal and subjective matter, and no one can condemn the other on the basis of some of his moral conduct until and unless it is harmful for the society. This concept of morality is in total contrast with all the religious discourses of the past. Islamic tradition is also very clear on this issue.\nThe 20 th century came up with the globalization phenomenon that resulted in the westernizing of values and cultures. So Islamic societies all over the world, and ours is a no exception, came under the direct influence of modern and post-modern debates. So, a lot of new school of thoughts emerged in order to reconciliate Islam with modernity. New terms entered in the studies of Islamic thoughts like Liberal Islam, Modern Islam, Reformist Islam, Islamism etc. An intellectual duel between traditionalists and modernists within the Islamic societies is prominent phenomenon of the 20 th century. Initially, these debates were only limited to intellectual discourses, but with the passage of time extremist approaches entered and the societies started to polarize on the basis of the views of those extremist proponents.\nThis article would study the divergent debates and trends gaining popularity in Islamic societies and the critique of tradition upon it with special reference to morality.\n\nLiterature Review\nToshihiko Izutsu, in his important work Ethico-Religious Concept in the Qur'ān, 2 gives a detailed account of the foundations of Islamic value system and compared the pre-Islamic morality with the system given by the Qur'an. He studied a number of moral values that were present in pre-Islamic society and said that \"the Pagan Arabs were in reality richly endowed with an acute sense of morality.\" 3 With the advent of Islam, many moral values were endorsed while rejecting others. Thus, a new system of ethics and moral values came into existence in the light of divine guidance. This value system made the nucleus of Muslim civilization that started in Medina in 7 th century AD and flourished in the next 1000 years in considerable parts of the world. Professor Izutsu devised a term \"Divine Ethics\" for this Islamic value system. 4 Zia-ud-Din Sardar in his important work Islam, Postmodernism and Other Futures 5 elaborated the challenges that all the religions including Islam have to face challenges posed by the narratives of post-modernism. Not only that the post-modern narratives cut the roots of absoluteness including religion but also refute the concept of any objective criterion for morality. As a result, there can be no absolute truth as well as an absolute system of morality possible. An atheist can be an ethical person but he has no objective criterion to verify his own view of morality.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION\nVolume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 'No God No Good,' an important article written by William Lane Craig 6 , asserts that \"Theism and naturalism are contrasted with respect to furnishing an adequate foundation for the moral life. It is shown that on a theistic worldview an adequate foundation exists for the affirmation of objective moral values, moral duties, and moral accountability. By contrast, naturalism fails in all three respects.\" 7 This article lays solid foundations for constructing a meaningful discourse of morality and values in atheistic world. This article although address the Kai Nielsen \"Why Should I be Moral?\" gives the view that: We have not been able to show that reason requires the moral point of view, or that all really rational persons should not be individual egoists or classical amoralists. Reason doesn't decide here. The picture I have painted for you is not a pleasant one. Reflection on it depresses me … Pure practical reason, even with a good knowledge of the facts, will not take you to morality.\" 8 If rationality doesn't guide us to morality then there must be some other basis for constructing a system of morality. The divine guidance is the only possible solution that can take man out of this chaos. It is evident from the above review that post-modernism as a successor philosophy of modernity has put a strong challenge to objective and absolute view of morality given by Islam.\nPostmodernism is a movement which appeared in reaction of modernism. The main focus of modernism is the quest for truth and for progress while postmodernism emphasizes on relativity, creation of realities and instability of everything. The birth place of postmodernism is France and the main proponents of postmodernism are Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), Michel Foucault (1926-1984, Jean-Francois Lyotard (1924Lyotard ( -1998, other philosophers of 19 th and 20 th centuries like Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), Martin Heidegger (1889-1976, Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914), William James (1842-1910 and John Dewey (1859Dewey ( -1952. However, it is widely considered that it was Nietzsche who was the first to propagate the post-modern ideals. He, in many of his writings is clearly seen as a relativist philosopher and thinker. His famous book Thus Spoke Zarathustra 9 gives an account of his philosophy. He was also the originator of the famous dictum 'God is Dead' 10 which means that all the authorities over Man including the authority of the religion is a thing of the past. These words show that according to him there is no longer any credible, objective and permanent source for moral justification present. In his book Antichrist he divided morality into two versions; master's morality and slave's morality. 11 Another place he says, \"there are no moral phenomena, only moral interpretations of phenomena.\" 12 In this way Nietzsche was in the favor of perspectivism. J. F Lyotard says: \"The language of science and the language of ethics and politics hold a profound relation and this relationship constitutes the cultural viewpoint of the West.\" 13\n\nThe Relationship of Religion and Morality\nThe term 'religion' owing to its panoramic dimensions is related to the matters associated with God and Man, that declare the creation as conscious and meaningful process and rejects the nihilistic worldview and it demands from its believers the performance of certain rituals and acts and to abstain from certain wrong doings. Many scholars and writers define this term in the sense of 'binding' which JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION Volume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 they expended as being bound through religion to God. In this particular connotation, it can also be considered as a cohesive force, which creates a link to God.\nIn Islam the Arabic word Deen, is used for describing the teachings of Islam as a whole. There are debates among Islamic scholars that Religion is not an exact synonym of Deen because Deen is far more comprehensive term than Religion and encompasses all the fields and aspects of human life. This view was propagated by many Islamist thinkers like Maulana Maududi, Dr. Israr Ahmed and others that Islam is a Deen that encompasses all the fields starting from an individual's personal matters to the matters of the state. In this context Islam is declared as a politico-socio-economic system. In this paradigm, the term connotes the struggle and hard work undertaken by the holy Prophet (PBUH) under arduous circumstances, to make the Deen Islam dominant in Arab.\nThis explanation of Islam is not a new one as in the traditional school of thoughts the debates related to society and morality were also included in the religious realm. Even the jurists classify the Islamic Jurisprudence in two types i.e. This insight provides an introductory base that tells who morality unlike the modern western views is an integral part of the teachings of Islam. Whether written \"Religion\" or \"Deen\" is certainly a metanarrative that form a world view to see and prioritize the concepts. It also suggests certain reorganizations of society, which is bound to be conformed to the divine law. This sort of particular relation of confirmation and reformation is not only the peculiarity of religion towards ethics but also in many other areas. This type of idiomatic relationship can be found between religion and politics, economics, history, anthropology and many other fields. In short it can be said that Islam influence ethics in several areas. It gives a criterion of \"Good\" and \"Evil\" and \"right\" and \"wrong\". This divine criterion can exclusively influence to correct moral ideas, it can assure or rectify our understanding about our societies and ourselves.\nThe above discussion shows that in Islam the traces of relationship between ethics and religion are evident, in order to comprehend their mutual influence it is crucial to see that in both cases of DEPARTMENT OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION Volume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 religious anthropology and religious sociology_ a coiled structure of independence is present which is specifically based on the supremacy of the religion.\n\nIslamic Absolutism vs Moral Relativism\nThe traditional Islam, is absolute in all its aspects and its concepts and doctrines are formed on the basis of revelation. Therefore, the room for relativism and relative truth is almost absent in that system of thoughts and the concept of personal Truth is a false proposition. Islam is convinced that the facts which derived only from human reason have certain limits and cannot transcend from the possibility of doubt and falsity in it. The concept of some universal values and principles developed on the basis of Divine revelation is not new in religious traditions. However, as a Muslim, we are a firm believer that it is the legacy of Islam which has a fully developed value system based upon the texts that are claimed to be absolutely authentic and not changed over time like other religious scriptures.\nIn Islamic tradition, revelation has always been given supremacy over reason. Where there is a proposition present through revelation then reason is not referred in this regard. This is because human intellect is not ultimate and it often deceives a person. Modernism gave an ultimate and inevitable position to human intellect and presented rationality as an ultimate truth. Like Postmodernists, Islamic thinkers cross-question this view before them (postmodernist thinkers). This discussion is also found in the thoughts of Imam Ghazali and Imam ibn-Tamiya. Imam Ghazali's criticism on Aristotle's logic with the use of his own (Aristotle) logical rules clearly shows that Ghazali considered the facts derived from intellect merely as illusion and an unreliable source for determining the meta physical realities. He had the view that the scopes of the universe and time are limitless, and the human intellect cannot apprehend limitlessness. Therefore, its observations and results derived from it have limitations.\nAccording to the Islamic point of view, the headspring of the ultimate truth is Allah Almighty. He is omniscient and His knowledge is all encompassing. \"Lo, nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah Almighty.\" 20 The same message is seen in Al-Baqara, \"He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them, while they encompass nothing of His knowledge save what He will.\" 21 Similarly, the facts which are the headspring of Ultimate Truth is the divine revelation from Allah Almighty and which manifested in the form of unequivocal Sunnah of His messenger are Absolute Truths. This is the sole criteria upon which all the claims of truth in this world are to be judged. If they are contradicting to Divine revelation, they are Absolute False; and if they are not contradicting, they would be judged true or false and right or wrong on the basis of previously known criteria. Hence only the orders and commands of Allah Almighty and the Sunnah of his Prophet (SAW) are innately right and true and all other judgments are to be analyzed upon this criterion. In practical life, Islam adopted this viewpoint in the matters of legislation and codification. It does not give a universal position to every matter like modernism and also does not reject universal rules and regulations like postmodernism. It gives universal status to basic rules and in the light of these universal rules and principles it opens the door of Ijtihād (process of legal reasoning and interpretation) through which the Jurist (mujtahid) derives law on the basis of the Qur'ān and the Sunnah for particular time, particular place and particular situation.\nIslam teaches the omnipresence of God that implies that the actual motivation behind abstaining from a Sin or wrongdoing is that Allah is seeing it and He would hold everyone accountable for all 20 Al-Qur'ān: Al-e-Imran, 3:5. 21 Al-Baqara, 2: 255.\n\nJOURNAL OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION\nVolume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 of his acts. It is clearly asserted in Qur'an that nothing can escape from Him. 22 This view rejects the doctrine that only that conduct is wrong which harm others. Moreover, Khatam-e-Nabuwwat is a fundamental view in the philosophy of Islam. One implication of this doctrine is that the divine guidance has been completed in the personality of the Prophet and it is relevant and binding for all the people and nations that have come and would come till the Day of Judgment. So, there is no possibility of a change that claims about the change in the fundamentals of Islam as they were decided. The Hālal and Harām that are given in the Qur'ān and the Sunnah are also final.\n\nIndividual Freedom, Human Rights and Islam\nThe contemporary world declares religious concept of morality as against the individual freedom of man. In lieu of this, Nietzsche declared the religious morality as morality of the slaves 23 because the attributes of humility and humbleness are more emphasized in it. It is therefore a hurdle in the development of high values and attributes in the personality of an individual. The concept of \"existence precedes essence\" 24 given by existentialists also declare individual freedom as the highest value that is to be achieved and anything that put a check on it or curtail it is to be rejected.\nBasic focus of morality in Islam is the concept of success (Falāh) in this life and hereafter. Islam keeps balance between society and individual. It takes welfare autonomy and harmony of individual and society in balanced way. Religion just focuses with the conscience of the individual. It means religion has equal concern with the development, benefit and welfare of society as well as individual.\nGod has prohibited through his commands from the things and actions which are not appropriate for individual as well as for the society. So, the Muslims should abide by these commandments whether they understand its benefits or not. It can be understood by the example of the prohibition of interest on loan. The majority of scholars consider the social harms and economic exploitation as the reason behind the prohibition of usury. The prohibition of murder, theft, fraud and so on are necessary for justice in society. Similarly, the purpose of the prohibition of adultery is that it destroys family system. These types of limitations provide a peaceful and healthy environment vital for the development of individual. Moreover, the people who are performing good deeds in this world would be blessed hereafter. Absolute justice could be achieved through the output of good deeds in shape of paradise and hell would be given to the wrong doers. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) practiced all these Qur'ānic injunctions and was titled as 'Al-Amīn' (the Trustworthy) and kept a sound foundation in ethics. There is also the existence of collective actions that are helpful for individual as well as the society and it cover all the aspects. It can be economic, 25 philanthropic, 26 judicial, 27 or armed 28 etc. In this way, only a good individual can progress a good and prosperous society. Thus, one can claim for a good society that can provide healthy environment for individual where he can perform right actions. These right actions spread in broader range and cover all areas of life and human activities including commerce and trade.\nThe concept of human rights in Islam is not because of recent western phenomenon but according to the Islamic jurists, it has more centralized position in Islam. Abul A'la Mawdudi a great Islamic scholar and revivalist argues that, \"Islam has laid down some universal fundamental rights for humanity as a whole, which are to be observed and respected under all circumstances DEPARTMENT OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION Volume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 …fundamental rights for every man by virtue of his status as a human being.\" 29 Some claimed that current human rights are what Islam has enforced fourteen century earlier. 30 Some other Muslim scholars consider that Islam is not \"inherently illiberal\" and it cannot be \"reconciled, at an abstract level of ideas, with the principles of human rights.\" 31 Contrary to these scholars, some claims that there is huge difference between the concept of Islamic rights and Western concept of rights.\nOne of the reason of Muslim scholars' critique on the Universal Declaration is because it is giving secular concept of fundamental rights and showing its hostility with Islam. 32 Abdulaziz Sachedina said on this point \"the very secular foundation of the Declaration is deemed epistemologically insufficient to account for the derivation of inherent and inalienable human rights.\" 33 Muslims were against the Universal Declaration from the very beginning due to its secular nature and other multiple reasons. Even participation of Muslim countries during the draft of declaration was minor. Only three Muslim countries, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Syria was the part of that committee. All Muslims members were \"secularly educated individuals\" and have no proper knowledge about \"foundational sources of Islamic tradition.\" 34 This was the fact that at that time Saudi representative was a Lebanese Christian and even Saudi Arabia did not caste vote in favor of Universal Declaration because its spirit was against Islamic law. 35 The main reason why Islamic concept is different from the Western concept of human rights is that all Islamic faiths are based on central belief which create difference that Islam does not endorse the difference between God and His obedience. The obedience of God has central position in Islam because directions of all rights are based on the concept of obligations and duties. The term of duty and obligation is quite natural and wider than the term of rights. Faith in oneness of Allah has fundamental position in Islam and all rights get its validity through the way of duties and obligations. When individual perform their duties and obligations, they get their rights through this way and those who are not acting upon their duties have no rights in Islamic Sharī'ah. Main source of rights in Islamic society is individual itself. 36 \"Thus, Islam stresses people's obligations to society rather than their rights against government.\" 37 Community has more importance than individual in Islamic society and the role of community in Islamic society is 'a solid wall whose bricks are supporting each other.' Islam emphasizes on collective good of society. 38 Islam is also promoting harmony, unity, fraternity and brotherhood of mankind through teaching that there is no difference between Arab and JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION Volume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 non-Arab, white and black. Same conditions are valid for non-believers living in Islamic state and paying poll tax in exchange of all rights like protection of life, freedom and property and freedom of worship. Non-believers have liberty to practice their religious practices without any interruptions and hurdles. 39 Islamic state secures unique position and practices egalitarian outlook when it provides basic necessities to its citizens as its prime responsibility. There is a separate portion for poor and needy in Islamic state. Sustenance of poor are the prime responsibility of state. 40\n\nMoral Relativism and Islamic Viewpoint\nThe fundamental characteristic of relativism is that there is no concept of absolute reality and truth. It rejects objective truth. Relativists claim that absolute truth is not existent. It is only the observer who perceives things according to his or her subjectivity and truth is according to his state of mind and observation. Therefore, Islam is not relativist in its spirit. Although, Islam permit others to spend their life according to their own ideology and according their own codes. Islam even tolerate those practices which it does not permit to its followers, hence the religious pluralism. But this is not relativism because Islam only allows it for non-believers and clearly give the ruling of Haram (forbidden) about them. Wine is strictly prohibited in Islam, but Muslims could not impose this rule to other members of community. For instance, Christians who are using wine for not only their personal use but also for their religious obligations. The state of Medina was governed under Islamic laws, but Jews of Medina were permitted to live their lives according to their own laws. But there were some exceptions adopted by Muslim state for religious minority as their status of a dhimmi. They could perform all their individual practices except those which can be harmful for general health and safety of the community. Islamic law provides absolute right of privacy to individuals and ensure security in their premises of private affairs and individuals are free from any intervention of the state.\nIt is a fact that Islamic teachings are inclusive and admit the needs of other members of society who are non-Muslims. Although, Saudi Arabia implemented the Islamic laws according to the Wahabi interpretations but there is wide space for non-Saudis where they can spend their lives according to their own laws. Even inhabitants of Saudi Arabia are free from any intrusion in their homes by the religious police. In this way, Islam is inclusive, and it will be a mistake to claim or adopt relativism for Islam. This is the fundamental belief of all Muslims that God has sent his messengers to all mankind, but the only difference is that the people could not preserve the message of God and corrupted it. On the contrary, Muslims have firm faith that God has preserved Qur'ān perfectly and it is free of any violations.\nThere are multiple and diverse shades and modes of life which are good and there are also certain and absolute objective standards that cannot be rejected: To thee We sent the scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so, judge between them by what God hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and a way of life? If God had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but [His plan is] to test you in what He hath given you: so, strive as in a race in all virtues. To God you will all return; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute. 41 It is reality that values are never relative, they are always absolute as the rule of honesty and fulfillment of contract in commerce apply to everyone without considering their religious beliefs. Therefore: Among the People of the Book are some who, if entrusted with a hoard of gold, will [readily] pay it back; others, who, if entrusted with a single coin, will not repay it unless you constantly stood demanding, because, they say, 'there is no blame on us [for what we may do] with these unlettered [outsiders],' but they tell a lie against God, and (well) they know it. 42 Furthermore, all the legal contracts are considered sacred and holy despite the intention and faith of contracting party. Same is the case of Islam, Islam produces a social system with Islamic contractual relations. Muslim states had actualized the system of non-secular pluralism. It was based on dhimmi system. According to this system, minorities spend their lives under the protection of Islamic state and enjoy their own laws and regulations in their communities with the exemption that they could not perform military duties and Muslim state would provide them protection from external aggression in return. This is the way that the rights of other communities and non-Muslims are protected within an Islamic state.\nIslam give absolute endorsement to some acts and values and give absolute rejection to other acts. These together form the list of Halāl and Harām in Islam. So, a religion with that much emphasis on the value system and with the detailed teachings cannot endorse relativistic concept. The teachings of Islam are absolute as well as upon an objective criterion, so relativism has no space in it in terms of judging the values. However, Islam gives space to non-believers to act according to their own beliefs; but this by no means inclined towards relativism as Muslims are completely aware that nonbeliever's belief is wrong. Thus, Islam upholds a pluralistic stance rather than relativistic one.\n\nAnalysis of Different Shades of Moral Relativism\nThe concept of moral relativism is divided into three major types i.e., descriptive, epistemological and normative. One can describe descriptive relativism in terms of different moral codes that are followed in different societies different concepts of \"virtue,\" \"Good\" and \"Evil\" prevails and they follow diverse ideals. Descriptive relativism doesn't find much controversy except the quantity of emphasis on diversity and difference and keeping all on the same plane. It implies that all are equal and there is no question of one's priority over the other. Moreover, no criticism is possible on other's values and morals. Islam cannot accept this and is exclusive in its approach. It gives clear ruling about matters that whether they are prohibited or permitted.\nThe second kind of moral relativism is normative relativism. The foundations of normative relativism are somewhat more haphazard as compare to descriptive relativism. It can be described in terms of attitude, because it demands complete passivity. To put this concept in concise words one can, say that, in the avenue of normative relativism, to pass any comment on one's morals would be considered as wrong and improper. In its extremity, moral relativism demands that no one should pass any sort of verdict about other's actions, beliefs, character or values. Although utmost form of normative relativism is dubious and almost every philosophic school is ready to defend it, despite of its flimsy nature it has gained much applause from the youngsters in west. However, it also seems that they are also not aware of it completely because they have recognized it as an offshoot of descriptive relativism. 43 The basis of normative relativism is detrimental, mainly due to its postulates 41 5:48. 42 Al-e-Imran, 3:75. 43 Emrys Westacott, \"Moral Relativism,\" Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, https://iep.utm.edu/moral-re/ JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION Volume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 of neglecting the distinction between right and wrong, as well as justice and injustice. The opposite of normative relativism is another extreme, which allows everyone to pass judgements of any sort on other's ideal, beliefs and characters. Islam curtails this sort of extreme position; it states that there are several aspects of person's life that ought to be remained with God only and no one can interfere in it. But at the same time Islam give a clear concept of Sin that is an action of disobeying God. 44 Epistemological relativism is another form of moral relativism which states that moral principles are dynamic they change with the change in the state of person, like it changes with how one thinks, believes and also on their schematas. Due to the extreme focus of epistemological relativism on person's thinking, his attitude, it has been associated with subjectivism, which somehow foreshadows epistemological relativism but not completely. Moral subjectivism is the claim that there is no objective morality. Thus, there is nothing, which universally affirms moral truths. Thus, subjectivity can be related to both individuals and society. They believe that right, good or virtuous is determined by the individuals or society and not shaped by some external force or religion. 45 All the shades of moral relativism have a common attribute in them that they deny absoluteness and objectivity in moral judgments and theoretically place all relative concepts of morality at same plane. In this way the exclusivity and authority, that is the integral part of religious morality system, is totally rejected. This is the fundamental difference between Islam and all types of Moral relativism. In Islam the morality and the concept of \"Good\" and \"Evil\" is given by Allah and it is that much exclusive that no other way of life is acceptable by Allah. As mentioned in the Holy Qur'ān at a number of occasions that Allah accepts only Islam as a way of living 46 and it is the sole authority of Allah to guide the people. 47 A misconception is created sometimes that there are religious people who hold some version of moral relativism. However, if it states that, right is to be measured by what pleases God and the authority lies with Him then it is not considerable as a form of relativism.\nIn a nutshell it is safely said that Islam's traditional position regarding moral judgments is very clear that it is dependent upon the divine criteria of Good and Evil given by Allah; and that is present in the form of Qur'an and Sunnah. Islam gives space to different opinions as well as it gives protection to everyone's privacy. But at the same time, it gives clear verdict about the criterion upon which everyone's conduct would be judged. This criterion is beyond time and space and is the only gateway for success in hereafter.\n\nConclusion\nIn a nutshell it can be summed up that man is the Khalifa of Allah on earth; and the sole purpose behind man's creation is to worship Allah. For the guidance of man Allah had always sent his messengers along with the divine guidance. The last edition of this divine guidance was concluded on Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the last and complete comprehensive book was bestowed by Allah in the form of the Holy Qur'ān. This book is now valid and binding for all the humanity up to the Day of Judgment; and both the Qur'ān and Sunnah, are eternal criterion for judging right and wrong.\nWith this divine guidance Allah has also gifted man with an innate sense of good and evil. Qur'ān appeals this inner self of man and ask him to meditate. The accountability of Man on the day judgment would be based upon the criterion of that divine guidance as well as upon the basis of this innate sense of good and bad to whom everyone is bestowed upon with. Moreover, man in his nature has positive traits and tendencies as well as some negative ones. It is obligatory for man to nourish 44 Ibid. 45 Ibid. 46 Al-e-Imrān, 3:20. 47 Al-Baqara, 2:120.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION\nVolume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 those positive traits and culminate the negatives ones. The teachings of Sharī'ah are there to help a person to nourish those positive traits and eradicate the negatives form his life.\nMoreover, this innate sense of \"Good\" and \"Evil\" although is a gift of Allah but it can be affected or polluted by external contaminations and some internal influences. It is therefore logical that the ultimate and final ruling related to right and wrong would be based upon divine guidance. The Holy Qur'ān with the practical example of the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (SAW) is sole and ultimate criterion for determining \"Good\" and \"Evil\" and giving all kind of judgments.\nMoral relativism, on the other hand, is the theory of morality that is endorsed by the age of modernity and postmodernism. It is founded on the base of two types of arguments. One is theoretical aspect that on the basis of philosophies evolving from renaissance to postmodernism reject all the traditional narratives including religious concepts of morality. The other aspect is practical and has arose because of the phenomenon of globalization that has shrunken the distances between different cultures. So, in order to maintain peace and harmony amongst the societies moral relativism is seen as a possible remedy. While it may guide the humanity to a certain extent, but can also result in the situation of moral dismay. This situation can result in the collapse of value system and decreasing the status of religious centers, which will in turn, create moral chaos in society which is not healthy for flourishing any society. By removing values and religious injunctions, moral relativists try to emphasize individuals to follow their own desires. So, in this way, postmodernists are destroying and deconstructing the value systems given by religions due to undermining conceptual structure and objectivity. 48 But it would not be an exaggeration if one claims that the idea of moral relativism has put a strong challenge to the orthodox as well as the religious concepts of morality; and the spirit of time that is under the strong influences of modernity and postmodernism, also is in favor of this concept. The rhetoric has presented it a possible solution that can bring harmony in the world but at the same time a huge danger of losing the absolute and collective grounds for all kinds of moral judgments is also attached with it that can result in the situation of a complete moral catastrophe."

              "Visual Study Of Hanjuang Motif Illumination In The Qur'an Mushaf Sundawi\n\nThis research is motivated by the illumination of the Hanjuang motif on the Sundawi Mushaf Al-Qur'an. Meanwhile, in general, manuscripts that are often circulated in fine print from middle eastern Indonesia use illumination with Islamic geometric patterns. The purpose of this study is to explain the Sundawi Mushaf Al-Qur'an in its entirety related to the formulation of the concept of visualization of Hanjuang motif illumination, explanation of Hanjuang motif illumination, and its influence on Sufism. This study uses descriptive qualitative methods with visual creation approaches and Sufism that systematically describe the things that are the focus of the research. The data collection technique used in this research is library research and field research in the form of document analysis and personal communication with designers, humanists and Sufism experts. The results of this study found that the visualization of Hanjuang motif illumination with Al-Qur'an Mushaf Sundawi is part of plants that exist in West Java and also as a means of introducing West Javanese ornaments in the Sundawi Qur'an. This visual illumination will have an impact on the synergy between the Al-Qur'an Mushaf Sundawi, the Hanjuang motif as part of culture and Sufism. The results of this study refer to the analysis of objects that are concrete or tangible and abstract or conceptual objects that do not refer to objects but the meaning possessed by the illumination object.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIslamic art cannot be separated from the values of Sufism (Sufism). Sayyed Hossein Nasr (as quoted by Iswahyudi, 2019; 3). Islamic art includes at least three things. The first reflects religious values, secular art does not exist. Second, it describes the polite spiritual qualities that are influenced by the values of Sufism. Third, there is a subtle complementarity between the Copyright (c) 2022 A M Ibrahim, A Y Ekawardhani 434 mosque and the palace in terms of the protection, use and function of the various arts. And in making works of art the ability of an artist to find a problem as a challenge is the potential of a very creative artist (Maulina, 2012). Manufacture or copying of manuscripts in Indonesia and seen from history is estimated to have existed since the 13th century (Lestari, 2016). Copying of mushafs was done traditionally or by handwriting method, then in the 18th century the method developed in a modern way, namely printing. Prints found in the 18th century or 1848 and 1854 were printed in Palembang. Furthermore, in the development of manuscript copying, it developed, which began using illumination decorations of geometric objects and flowers and leaves from the Middle East, changing to using illumination decorations from objects in Indonesia.\nAccording to the history of the archipelago, the oldest printed Qur'anic manuscripts were extended to Palembang since the founding of the Islamic kingdom in Pasay. The oldest known lithograph belongs to Haji Muhammad Azari bin Kemas Haji Abdullah, completed on 21 Ramadhan 1264 H or 21 August 1848 AD. As far as is known, this is the mushaf, which is believed to be the oldest printed work in Southeast Asia. Artifacts previously known only existed in Abd Azim Amin's collection in Palembang, South Sumatra. Manuscript printing art began in the archipelago in the mid-19th century, when Muhammad Azari wrote and printed the first manuscript in the region in 1848. Based on available evidence, Muhammad Azhari also copied another manuscript which was completed in 1854. During this early printing period , there are several Indonesian writers who also work at the Singapore Mushaf printing press. Among the authors are Muhammad Hanafi bin Sulaiman al-Sumbawi and (possibly the same person, or brother) Haji Muhammad bin al-Marhum Sulaiman Sumbawi (Harun, 2016).\nThe writing of the Al-Qur'an Mushaf Sundawi is one of the mushaf works made with motifs found in West Java. The art of illumination is not only for decoration, but there are spiritual values related to transcendence to God. President Soeharto. The substance or content of the speech is the mandate to harmonize development in the material and spiritual fields in order to welcome the Second National Awakening and the 2nd Phase Long-Term Development Program  The writing of the Sundawi Mushaf Al-Qur'an is a form of response or reflection of the concrete elaboration of the initiative of all the people of West Java to harmonize development in their region, especially in the spiritual field, in accordance with what was contained in President Soeharto's message. Apart from that, moreover, the tradition of copying or writing manuscripts has existed in the archipelago since the 13th century, so that the form of culture in the form of manuscript writing continued until the writing of the Sundawi Mushaf Al-Qur'an was carried out, as a symbol that can be used as a symbol for maintaining the Islamic religion and traditions. the writing of the Qur'an in the land of Pasundan, and is a sacred wish of the people of West Java in order to maintain and uphold the values of the majesty and sanctity of the Qur'an (Rodibillah et al, 2018).\nThe Sundawi Al-Qur'an Mushaf is also inseparable from a cultural approach, where Islam entered Indonesia initially through a combination of religious and cultural teachings. As explained in history, the oldest date indicating that there were Muslims entering and living in the West Java region was in the first half of the 14th century. Local historical sources recorded by Hageman (1866) state that the first Muslim to come to West Java was Haji Purwa in 1250 Java or 1337 AD. Haji Purwa is the son of the Lalean Horse. Haji Purwa converted to Islam when he was on a business trip to India. He was converted to Islam by an Arab merchant who happened to meet him in India. Haji Purwa tried to convert his younger brother who was in power in an inland kingdom in Tatar Sunda to Islam. However, the attempt failed. Finally Haji Purwa left Galuh to and then settled in Cirebon Girang (Mumuh, 2010).\nThe Illuminations of the Qur'an are part of the unique religious and intellectual heritage of the Islamic world. Illumination is one of the works of art that usually accompanies the art of calligraphy which aims to support the text or verses of the Qur'an. In the 6th century AD, the Qur'an at that time was written in the Kufa style with no punctuation marks (harakat) (TPP Al-Qur'an Mushaf Sundawi, 1997). The arrival of Islam in West Java brought not only ideological teachings but also customs, art, language, writing and other cultural elements. The existence of Islamic culture caused a mixture of cultures, as it is known that before the arrival of Islamic culture in West Java, there was already a prehistoric culture and animist beliefs and dynamism developed. The existence of sara elements in the socio-cultural order of the people of West Java has led to cultural acculturation and has allowed syncretism to occur in society.\nIn addition, the existence of a new religious element, namely Islam, allows syncretism to occur in the socio-cultural life of the people of West Java. This is because before the arrival of Islam, people had embraced animism and dynamism which were hard to get rid of. However, society tries to align the newly entered beliefs with previous beliefs. As explained by Suhirman, syncretism is creating something new by combining certain elements or some components of the teachings of several beliefs to become an integral part of the new belief. This mix of beliefs can be traced through cultural forms that are artifactual and non-artifactual (Mansyur, 2016).\nThe Sundawi Mushaf Al-Qur'an is a Mushaf of the Al-Qur'an which is made using the form of illumination ornaments taken from the characteristics and culture of West Java. Overall, there are 20 illumination designs on the Sundawi Mushaf Al-Qur'an, consisting of 17 cultural areas and 3 special designs that adorn the Ummul Qur'an, Nisful Qur'an and Khotmul Qur'an pages. The Sundawi Mushaf Al-Qur'an has two types of design reference sources, the first comes from West Javanese Islamic motifs such as mamolo mosques, batik motifs carved from pulpits, mihrabs, and other artifacts that are neither anthropomorphic nor zoomorphic. The second type of motif originates from a number of specific West Javanese flora such as Gandaria, Hanjuang and Patrakomala. And among these flora, one of them has spiritual value and symbol for the people of West Java, namely Hanjuang. This research will refer to the analysis of objects that are concrete or tangible and objects that are abstract or conceptual which can be interpreted in Sundanese and Sufism culture, namely first analyzing objects that are tangible or visually visible and secondly objects that are conceptual which do not refer to objects but meaning possessed by the object.\n\nMETHOD\nThe research method used is descriptive qualitative method. This method is carried out by collecting information by determining objects and topics, observing, determining informants, interviews, data collection and data analysis related to Illumination on the Al-Qur'an Mushaf Sundawi. The approach used is multidisciplinary, namely using more than two disciplines, including the science of visual creation, cultural syncretism and Sufism.\nSources of supporting data in the study of the Visual Illumination of the Al-Qur'an Mushaf Sundawi study were taken from several sources, namely literature and interviews. Bibliographical sources include related journals and books. While interview sources to confirm data information relating to research.\nData analysis techniques In this study, the authors used three data collection techniques. 1) Data Reduction 2) Data presentation/display 3) Data Verification (Conclusions drowing/verifying) Research data testing techniques are activities that have a function so that research results can be accounted for from all sides. Data validity test in qualitative research consists of internal validity (credibility), external validity (transferability), reliability (depenadability), and objectivity (confirmability) (Sugiyono, 2007).\n\nRESULT AND DISCUSSION\nHanjuang is one of the plants that grows a lot in the land area of Sunda, West Java. Apart from functioning as a protective plant and barrier in rice fields or fields, Hanjuang plants are also often planted as a barrier or fence in the yard. For the people of West Java, Hanjuang is a plant that is considered special, not only considered as an ornamental and medicinal plant, but also as a guardrail against various disturbances from supernatural powers and disease outbreaks (Sunarni, 2016). without wisdom\". From this verse it can be expanded that everything on earth has its benefits, one of which is the Hanjuang plant (Fawzi, 2022). Hanjuang which grows a lot in the Tatar Sunda region, especially West Java is very special. Not only as a cultural symbol, hanjuang is also a symbol of acculturation of culture and religion or monotheism. Like the hanjuang that is planted on a grave, the Sundanese people make it a sign that there is the grave of their relative, whereas according to some Muslims who believe it is an intermediary between the natural world and the natural spirit or barzah.\nHanjuang has a variety of colors, such as red, yellow and green. Judging from the type and color have their respective positions. Hanjuang red is often found and planted in yards of houses and fields as a barrier or fence. Green hanjuang is often used in ritual traditions such as weddings, quarterly, sevenmonthly and births.\nAccording to Nasrullah (personal communication, 2022), said that there is a hadith quote that can be used as a reference, the hadith is \"Remember, actually these two corpses are being tortured but not because they have committed a major sin. One of them was tortured because he used to make slander and another was tortured because he did not avoid splashing urine. Then his king took the palm fronds which were still wet and split them into two. After that he planted one of them in the first grave and the other one in the second grave, saying: May this frond can ease his torment while he is not yet dry.\" (History of Bukhari, no: 1378 and Muslim, no: 292). The Ulama equate the date palm fronds in the hadith above with all kinds of plants that are still wet, and this can be interpreted or all plants. The people of the archipelago, especially the Sundanese, use the Hanjuang as a substitute for date palm fronds.\nIn this part of the discussion, this research refers to the analysis of objects that are concrete or tangible and objects that are abstract or conceptual which are interpreted in Sundanese culture and Sufism. The first is to analyze tangible objects, namely those that can be seen, touched and received visually. Such as the shape of the Mushaf of the Al-Qur'an, the visual illumination found in the Mushaf of the Al-Qur'an, the shape of the Hanjuang plant and the shape of the mamolo which is found at the top of the mosque's dome.\nThe second is a conceptual object, that is, the object mentioned does not refer to the object but to the concept that the object has. For example, the mamolo which is above the mosque can be interpreted as its position not on the object but on its concept and the illumination of the hanjuang which forms a triangular pattern with its position in the top center can be interpreted by a conceptual understanding of Sufism.\nThe illumination of the hanjuang motif in the Sundawi Mushaf Al-Qur'an in its composition has several forms of objects composed. And the composition of the shape becomes the focus of the part being analyzed. The shape object selected from the illumination motif of Copyright (c) 2022 A M Ibrahim, A Y Ekawardhani 439 the Al-Qur'an Mushaf Sundawi focuses on the shape of the hanjuang contained in the crown or tiara section, 3 object shapes are selected, the frame or frame section is selected 2 shape objects and the Letter name frame section is selected 1 shape object.\nThe visual illumination in the first form is its position in the top center of the Tiara in the illumination composition space. The shape of the motif is three hanjuang leaves that point vertically, plus the shape of tendrils. In the view of Sufism, the motive conveyed by Ramdan Fawzi can be analogous to faith, Islam and ihsan. Where human life is interconnected, namely faith about human belief in God, Islam about muamalah or relationships with fellow creatures, and ihsan about virtue or wisdom in living life. If the religion of Islam is likened to a tree, then faith is the root, Islam is the trunk, branches and branches, while ihsan is the fruit that fascinates everyone who sees it. Visual illumination in the second form is its position on the right and left in the illumination composition space. The form of vertical illumination is like a pillar that maintains balance because the position is right and left so that it is balanced. Because God created everything in pairs, as written in the Al-Qur'an Surat Az-Zariyat (51: 49), namely \"And everything that We created in pairs so that you may remember the greatness of Allah\", in this verse it is explained that everything something that on earth was created in pairs by Allah SWT. The visual illumination in the triple shape is its position at the right end and left end of the illumination composition space. The form of the illumination motif consists of four lined leaves that form an inward arch, as the philosophy of plants or plants, the more full or towering, the more they will bow down. If it is related to the context of life, we can learn from this philosophy that the order of human life that has high positions, lots of wealth and abundant wealth is not a measure for someone to act arrogantly like the shape of the hanjuang leaf above. The visual illumination in the fourth and fifth forms is its position in the center of the frame illumination composition space. In Sufism, it is analogous as a sign that humans exist between two sides, be it the vertical or horizontal center which repeats itself like a life cycle process. Starting from the spirit then born -baby -child -teenager -adult -old -dies and returns to being a spirit.\n\nFigure 6. Illumination visuals on the fourth and fifth forms\nThis information is contained in the Qur'an Surah Shad verse 72 (creation of the spirit) \"Then when I complete the incident and I blow into him My spirit (creation); then you should fall down prostrate to him \", Al-Qur'an Surah Al-Anbiya verse 35 (death) \"Every soul will taste death. We will test you with bad and good as a (true) trial. And only to Us will you be returned.\" Visual illumination in the sixth form is its position on the right and left in the space for the illumination of the letter's name frame. The form of illumination comes from the leaves of the hanjuang which face up and down. This form is analogous in the view of Sufism, hanjuang which faces upward is about the relationship with God, while hanjuang which points downward is the relationship between humans and other creatures (humans, animals and nature). The tendency to believe in God is human nature from the beginning, as explained in Surah Al-Rum verse 30, \"Then set your face straight towards the religion of Allah; (stay on) the fitrah of Allah who has created human beings according to that fitrah. There is no change in the nature of Allah. (That is) the straight religion; but most people do not know.\" and Al-A'raf verse 172, \"And"

              "Normative account of Islamic bioethics in end-of-life care\n\nABSTRACT This article addresses the bioethical challenges raised by end-of-life care (EoLC) from the perspective of Islamic normativity. Rejecting positivist positions, it argues for the use of a flexible approach midway between a deontological conception of human life as having a sacred value that cannot be bargained over, as represented by the teachings of Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī's, and one that introduces considerations of pain (alam) and pleasure (ladhdah) into ethical evaluations, as expounded by the jurist Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī. Under this approach, described as “Islamic evaluator relativity,” moral agents formulate a normative position tailored to their beliefs and the circumstances of the case, in which the right course of action is expressed as a value judgement (amr ijtihādi) and the evaluator (mujtahid) is rewarded regardless of the choices they make. Keywords: Islamic bioethics, End-of-life-care, bioethics, normative ethics.\n\n\nIntroduction\nAdvancements in medical technology have greatly reshaped approaches to death, the dying process, and the provision of end-of-life care (EoLC). Even when a medical diagnosis or prognosis has determined that a patient is terminally ill due to an incurable disease, death may be kept at bay by various means, including medication, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition and hydration. A person receiving EoLC, even when in a critical condition, continues to have a moral existence, nonetheless. In such situations, ethicists seek to establish what is good and right by weighing the ethical value of human life against the pain and suffering of patients, their quality of life, financial and emotional burdens to their families, and costs to healthcare resources. Healthcare providers, patients, and their families face challenging moral dilemmas in relation to EoLC. Human life is at stake, and stakeholders often find themselves having to make moral choices: Is an act or an omission that allows death to occur the right course to follow? Is it morally preferable to prolong life regardless of the consequences for the patient and the healthcare system? Dominant thinking in secular bioethical discourse posits that patients are autonomous moral agents with total control over their destiny, and thus, as far as is possible, they should have the final say on sanctioning or even performing acts or omissions to end their lives. Where this is not possible, healthcare providers and surrogate decisionmakers may refer to normative principles when engaging in consequentialist calculations of harm and benefit to determine the right course of action. Suppose medical advice concludes a patient is terminally ill and no treatment is possible. Physicians may be of the opinion that more harm than good would be done by keeping the patient alive through medication, further procedures, or medical devices. The right course of action would then be that which allows death to happen.\nIn Islamic doctrine on moral obligations, the ethical challenges posed by EoLC remain largely unaddressedat least, not directly. Guidance can nonetheless be derived indirectly from the fact that the doctrine portrays human life as having supreme ethical value. Muslim jurists are unanimous in thinking that the Islamic system of ethics is characterized by a vision in which the preservation of human life becomes in itself an end or objective (maqsad) that should inform and orient moral reasoning. In other words, they assert the normative character of the duty to preserve human life. In principle, when Muslims are faced with the need to reach an Islamic moral judgement (ḥ ukm al-sharʿi) on questions of life and death, they should determine that the right thing to do is to preserve human life and that it is morally reprehensible to engage in acts or omissions that would result in the termination of life. However, this strict obligation to protect life may be a cause of great moral distress for the physicians, patients, and surrogate decision-makers involved in EoLC. For instance, literally understood, the duty to preserve life means that doctors have an imperative obligation to heal. However, if the doctors agree that a patient is terminally ill and that there is very good reason to withhold or withdraw all medical interventions and let the patient die, does this prognostic supersede the duty to heal? In other words, does the overarching obligation to preserve life translate into an extended commitment to preserve life at all cost and in all circumstances?\nThis article starts with the proposition that, in the Islamic worldview, EoLC does not deprive human life of its moral existence, with the consequence that its sanctity must be safeguarded. When discussing EoLC in an Islamic context, it is an essential preliminary, therefore, to delineate the scope of the duty to preserve life, before physicians, patients, and surrogate decision-makers can engage in harm and benefit analysis to decide on the right course of action to take. Existing literature draws on premodern Islamic legal theory and paradigm cases in proposing practical solutions for dealing with terminal illness. However, it offers little guidance on what to make of the paramount duty to respect the sanctity of human life.\nThe research underlying the article began with a scoping review (Daudt et al., 2013) of the literature on EoLC in Islamic sources relevant to EoLC. The review took in sources in both Arabic and English, with particular attention being given to modern fatwas issued by prominent Islamic institutions, including the Council of Islamic Jurisprudence, al-Azhar, the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, and the European Council for Fatwa and Research. An analysis of these sources revealed that the predominant approach adopted in Islamic bioethical discourse on EoLC is to start from a position of legal positivismthat is to say, reasoning that relies on the existence of a rule already established as part of premodern Islamic jurisprudence. For instance, jurists justify the permissibility of acts or omissions leading to the death of terminally ill patients by referring to premodern opinions on the moral status of medical treatment (tadāwī), according to which medical treatment is not obligatory in all cases; in particular, it is not mandatory for patients who are terminally ill. In other words, it is assumed that from premodern jurisprudence a rule has been inferred which affirms the optional character of the tadāwī, and that rule is then applied to a wide range of bioethical challenges in EoLC. Yet, in the context of current bioethical deliberations, very little is said about the rule's merits vis-à-vis broader ethical and normative precepts in Islamic systems of ethics, including the moral value of human life. In this sense, Islamic positivism stands in the tradition of Austinian legal positivism, which separates law and morality. As Austin wrote, \"the existence of law is one thing; its merit and demerit another. Whether it be or be not is one enquiry; whether it be or be not conformable to an assumed standard, is a different enquiry.\" (1832/1995, p. 157).\nI take issue with the reliance on positivist reasoning to formulate Islamic responses to bioethical challenges in relation to EoLC. When analyzing and addressing the ethical challenges posed by EoLC. Islamic bioethical discourse should rather consider the sources of Islamic moral obligation from an ethical perspective. The methodology I am proposing follows the structure of normative theories (Dreier, 1993). This article shows that it is possible to construct broad normative Islamic principles for the purpose of assessing, justifying, and governing ethical decisions related to EoLC. This possibility has been overlooked in existing Islamic bioethical reasoning, which uses paradigm cases to determine the permissibility of a given act or omission related to EoLC. From a normative perspective, there is no good reason why ethical interrogations concerning EoLC should necessarily be articulated in positivist language of the kind: Is X permitted or prohibited, and under what conditions? Preformed ethical responses are to be avoided. Instead, I advocate relying on Islamic legal theory (i.e. maqās id al-Sharīʿah) to construct a flexible normative methodology for dealing with EoLC ethics.\nThe crux of my argument is that Islamic moral norms cannot be derived exclusively from positivist reasoning based on an inflexible reading of textual sources and the application of paradigm cases. Since the 10th century CE, jurists have proposed a normative reading of the textual sources through maqās id al-Sharīʿah (normative objectives of textual sources deemed to be objectives of Islamic law). I follow leading scholars of maqās id al-Sharīʿah in showing that Islamic sources of moral obligation offer two broad normative approaches to ethical questions bearing on the value of human life. The first is rooted in a fundamental deontological conception of human life as a sacred value that cannot be bargained over in consequentialist pain/pleasure or cost/ benefit calculations. This general deontic vision can be located in Abū H  āmid al-Ghazālī's perception of the ethical value of life. The second approach, while still stressing the importance of human life, uses a consequentialist method to assess its value. In doing so, it introduces considerations of pain (alam) and pleasure (ladhdah) into ethical evaluations. In this approach, a jurist reasons in terms of what will maximize good (pleasure) and minimize evil (pain). The jurist Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, for example, was an early exponent of this normative approach. I propose an approach to EoLC ethics that lies between these two competing positions. When facing ethical dilemmas in EoLC, moral agents could strike a balance between these two approaches by formulating a normative position tailored to their beliefs and to the circumstances of the case. Here, the right thing to do will be framed as a value judgement (amr ijtihādi) and, as a famous Islamic maxim has it, the evaluator (mujtahid) will be rewarded regardless of the choices they make. To describe this midway approach, I will use the expression \"Islamic evaluator relativity.\" In comparative ethics, the notion of evaluator relativity has started to gain popularity as a means of determining the moral status of acts and omissions. The praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of certain value judgements will sometimes depend on the identity of the evaluator. For instance, if the morally required choice for some is to save a greater number of lives, we cannot blame a father for choosing to save his son even if this leads to the death of more persons. Evaluator relativity recognizes the father as a moral agent, acknowledges his wish that his child be saved, and affirms that this wish has superior ethical value over the abstract aim of saving lives unrelated to a specific moral agent (Sen, 1983).\n\nEnd-of-life medical conditions in an ethical context\nEoLC is full of agonizing moral dilemmas. Modern medical technology and biochemistry developments have made it possible to relieve pain and sustain cardiac and respiratory activities and organ functions. Patients who suffer from life-limiting injury or sickness can be kept alive by providing them with the ability to breathe, digest food, and communicate with others. While technology may offer a means of sustaining patients' lives, it does not necessarily cure terminal illnesses. Treatment for patients in EoLC is typically classified as futile. Futility generally means that recovery is improbable and that the quality of life and benefit to the patient is unacceptably low (O'Connor et al., 2011;White et al., 2016). Depending on the nature of illness or injury, the patient in EoLC may be conscious and able to express their feelings and desires about the need to continue with the treatment. For instance, patients who have quadriplegia or are suffering from end-stage metastatic cancer may still be able to communicate with their families and healthcare professionals. Other patients may be unconscious and have lost their communication ability because of brain injury or advanced dementia.\nPatients in EoLC are generally admitted to palliative care, which, according to the World Health Organization, is not intended to hasten or postpone death but to improve the quality of life by alleviating pain and other distressing symptoms (World Health Organization, n.d.). Life in the EoLC environment, even with the most advanced palliative technologies, can still impose significant hardships and deplete health resources and family funds. On top of that, the prospects of returning to a healthy life can be very slim. Bioethical discourse on EoLC has traditionally sought to address the following questions: What should we make of the moral obligation to preserve life in EoLC? Does it include an ancillary duty to prolong the life of terminally ill patients? Is it ethical for the patient, healthcare providers, and families to ask or engage in acts or omissions that eventually lead to death?\nThe different scenarios posed by EoLC led ethicists to investigate the moral status and ethical justifications for euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, and withholding or withdrawing medical treatment, among other issues. Ethicists typically start from the normative framework provided by Beauchamp and Childress. They suggest that, in general, bioethical interrogations are best addressed through what they call \"common morality,\" which they describe as \"a range of norms that all morally serious persons share\" (2008, p. 3). These norms manifest themselves in four normative principles. The first is the principle of autonomy, which requires decision-makers to respect the individual's right to self-governance. The second is nonmaleficence, a normative principle that requires evaluators to minimize harm. The third is beneficence, a normative principle that requires evaluators to maximize benefits. And the fourth is justice, a set of norms designed to ensure fair distribution of benefits, risks, and costs (2008, p. 12).\nIn EoLC, if the patient is conscious and is (was) able to communicate their desire through an immediate request or directives in advance, they can decide to withhold or withdraw medical treatment. Moral judgements of this sort are usually justified by reference to the principle of autonomy. A conscious patient with legal capacity has the power to decide their fate, and healthcare professionals cannot impose medical treatment that the patient rejects. In the judicial context, courts in the West routinely emphasize the normative importance of the principle of autonomy, with some courts declaring that the principle of autonomy prevails over the sanctity of life (e.g. Brightwater Care Group v. Rossiter [2009] WASC 229 (Austl.)). Furthermore, those who stretch the principle of autonomy to its fullest extent would argue that there are legitimate moral grounds for patients requesting euthanasia or medical assistance to commit suicide if their quality of life is no longer acceptable to them (De Haan, 2002, p. 154;Gorsuch, 2000, p. 657). As for unconscious or mentally impaired patients, the principles of nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice have traditionally been used to justify decisions to continue or cease medical treatment. These principles provide normative guidance that enables decision-makers to engage in a utilitarian analysis weighing harm and benefit for the patient in terms of the prospect of recovery, levels of pain, and quality of life. They also enable decision-makers to consider the efficient allocation of healthcare resources to ensure they are used in the most productive manner. For instance, if the patient's desires are unknown, the family can decide on medical treatment even if this leads to death. Moreover, physicians can unilaterally withdraw or withhold medical treatment that they consider futile to the patient and wasteful of medical resources.\n\nIslamic responses\nThe developing field of Islamic bioethical literature as it stands today does not offer a general normative theory for analyzing the complex practical scenarios of EoLC. This lack of general normative standards becomes particularly noticeable if we compare the process of reasoning over EoLC in Islamic discourse with comparative bioethical discourse. As mentioned above, comparative bioethical literature followed Beauchamp and Childress's lead in adopting an overarching theoretical justification for bioethical decision-making based on the notion of common morality and the four principles of biomedical ethics. The process of moral reasoning in comparative bioethical moral reasoning starts from a general theory of ethical value. It then proposes normative principles that ultimately guide decision-making at the level of individual cases.\nAs far as Islamic bioethical reasoning is concerned, this broad form of normative analysis has yet to be incorporated in Islamic discourse on the ethical challenges of EoLC. The current process of reasoning is primarily positivist, not normative. Responses to ethical challenges in EoLC are fashioned using classic paradigm cases. Moral judgements are made on the basis of a deductivist approach rather than a normative vision that would allow flexibility in responding to the complex and evolving ethical challenges raised by EoLC. That said, a strand can be discerned in Islamic literature on bioethics which seeks out conceptual similarities between the four principles and established Islamic norms and maxims. For instance, authors such as Mustafa (2014) and Serour (1994) have suggested that Islamic juridical rules on averting harm and causing good show that Islamic jurisprudence recognizes a normative authority equivalent to the considerations underpinning Beauchamp and Childress's four principles. However, these authors do not seem to view Islamic jurisprudence as an ethical discourse in which human life is seen as a central ethical value engendering complex and conflicting normative positions.\nBefore critically assessing the positivist thesis of Islamic bioethics, it is important to point out that the principle of autonomy has very little normative force in dictating Islamic ethical responses to EoLC issues (cf. Sachedina, 2006). This is perhaps the most fundamental difference between Islamic and Western philosophy on bioethics. In general, the notion of autonomy is not central to the Islamic ethics system. While human life has an intrinsic ethical value, it does not seem to extend to an ancillary recognition of an unlimited right to self-governance. A human being is not empowered to make decisions to end their life. In Islamic theology, God is the ultimate owner of life, and the human is a mere trustee. In principle, subjective assessment of one's medical condition, quality of life, levels of pain, and financial costs cannot justify decisions that lead to the ending of one's life. Accordingly, individual Islamic scholars and institutions unanimously agree on a categorical prohibition on acts and omissions leading to or precipitating death or assisting the patient to commit suicide. This strict normative vision persists even when the patient is terminally ill, as affirmed by the Islamic Organization of Medical Sciences (1981) and in the resolutions adopted at the 11th session of the European Council for Fatwa and Research and Research (ECFR), Stockholm, Sweden, July [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]2003, and the 22nd session of the Islamic Fiqh Academy (IFA), Kuwait City, May 10-13, 2015. Individual human perception or moral intuition cannot dictate morally required choices as far as human life is concerned. Existing Islamic biomedical discourse would only accept an objective medical assessment of futility as an empirical authority for the right action.\nMedical futility is taken to be inevitable in cases of brain death. Since 1986, when the Council of Islamic Jurisprudence declared in its resolution on resuscitation apparatus that doctors may cease all medical intervention without fear of religious responsibility in the event of total cessation of all cerebral functions and where such cessation is irreversible, there would seem to be agreement that the patient is already dead and that there is no life to preserve through medical treatment. However, moral uncertainty frequently arises, with greater intensity, when evaluating the ethical status of withdrawing and withholding medical treatment for patients who are deemed terminally ill. A \"terminally ill patient\" is an open-ended concept that covers a wide range of medical conditions. In any given terminal illness situation, stakeholders are dealing with a human life, the preservation of which is a moral duty. At the same time, pressing ethical questions arise about the right course of action to take in the light of calculations of harm/benefit to the patient, their family, and the healthcare system. Here, as I show below, Islamic bioethical discourse could benefit from a philosophically grounded ethical theory on the basis of which to evaluate and justify the right conduct.\nThere is a line of thought which considers it impermissible to withhold or withdraw medical treatment from moribund patients, viewing this act or omission as a violation of the categorical moral duty to preserve human life (Ghaly et al., 2018, p. 45, 46;citing Jabbūrī, 2015). Likewise, when asked about withdrawing medical treatment from terminally ill patients at the 23rd Intentional Medical Conference of ʿAin Shams University, February 21-24, 2000, the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, Sheikh Muhammad Tantawy, responded that it was prohibited as a form of euthanasia and that neither terminal illness nor the futility of a case could justify active termination of medical treatment (al-Jufaiyyrī, 2008). The idea that the patient is dying due to the underlying medical condition seems to be ignored; instead, there is a focalization on the causal link between stopping medical treatment and the patient's death. The argumentnot unlike that in comparative bioethical discourse (e.g. McGee, 2011, p. 469;Rachels, 2001, p. 949;Winkler, 1995) is that the patient stays alive as long as they are provided with lifesaving means and thus their death results from withdrawing those means. Such accounts give the moral duty to preserve life normative priority over utilitarian considerations based on harm and benefit. Accordingly, the act of withdrawing or withholding medical treatment that leads to death is considered as blameworthy as intentional killing. According to Ghaly et al. (2018, p. 29, citing Jabbūrī), this ethical position was considered applicable even to brain-dead patients in the eyes of those scholars who stressed the sanctity of human life and believed that its preservation was an obligation imposed by God.\nHowever, the dominant position in Islamic bioethical responses, from both individual scholars and institutions, considers it permissible to withdraw or withhold medical treatment for \"futile cases.\" According to Yusuf al-Qarad  āwī (2013), if specialist doctors decide that a person is terminally ill and that life-saving medical treatment is not possible, the doctors have no duty, under Islamic law, to continue with medical treatment. Al-Qarad  āwī's opinions came in a short fatwa and included a statement affirming their general applicability to all cases that doctors deem medically futile. Similar positions were taken by al-Bār (2015) and by Permanent Committee for Research and Fatwa in Saudi Arabia, whose 1989 fatwa 12086 stated that if three competent specialist physicians are of the opinion that resuscitative measures would be useless and inappropriate for a certain patient, then there is no need for those measures to be carried out. Some international institutions, including the Islamic Fiqh Academy at its 22nd session in 2015 and the European Council for Fatwa and Research at its 11th session in 2003, have similarly accepted that Muslims have no religious duty to treat terminally ill patients and that withdrawing or withholding medical treatment is permissible, subject to confirmation of the futility of the treatment by three physicians.\nTypically, when justifying the permissibility of withholding or withdrawing medical treatment, jurists consult premodern juridical discourse on tadāwī (the moral status of seeking medical treatment). References are normally made to al-Ghazālī's opinion in Ih  yāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn. Al-Ghazālī holds that: \"it is permissible to forgo medical treatment if a person is moribund\" (Ih  yāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn, n.d., p. 287). However, the bulk of modern Islamic bioethical literature cites Ibn Taymiyyah's discussion of prevailing thinking on tadāwī in classic Islamic legal theory. According to Ibn Taymiyyah, seeking medical treatment is not always obligatory. Tadāwī could only be obligatory to Muslims when there is some certainty (qaṭ ʿ) or high probability (z  ann rājih  ) that it is life-saving. However, tadāwī's ethical status shifts from obligatory to permissible when it is futile (Ibn Taymiyyah,n.d.,p. 260). In such cases, physicians, patients, and families can engage in acts and omissions to terminate medical treatment, even if this leads to certain death.\nIt should be noted that jurists justify their position on stopping medical treatment by relying on rudimentary deductive reasoning from paradigm cases in a unidirectional way. They cite and take for granted the rule that tadāwī is not obligatory. Then, they apply this rule at the case level to justify medical decisions that affect treatment in EoLC. The ethical justification for the rule on tadāwī finds its primary source (though not the only one) in the exemplary behaviors of the Prophet's companions. Jurists typically argue that Abū Bakr or Muʾādh ibn Jabal rejected medical treatment for moribunds (al-Bār, Ahkâm al-Tadāwī, 1995, pp. 39-41). Therefore, Muslims can make value judgements about their EoLC decisions, including decisions that lead to terminating life-sustaining measures.\nHowever, this unidirectional deductivism fails to provide a general normative framework for justifying ethical judgements in EoLC. First, Islamic legal theory does not normally place the exemplary behavior of the companions as an unquestionable source for moral actions. Jurists of uṣ ūl have usually debated the organizing authority of this source. This is particularly true when dealing with complex ethical situations that lack clear scriptural guidance, as is the case for EoLC (al-Bagha, Athar al-Adillah, n.d., p. 339). Accordingly, it would be contrary to the general framework of Islamic legal theory to suggest that positivist reasoning from paradigm cases on tadāwī is sufficient to address EoLC challenges. Second, if we follow the normative reading for the value of human life that will be presented below, it would be challenging to accept the proposition that tadāwī should be viewed as optional. This form of classic positivism will have us accept isolated practices of companions as authority for the right action without further investigation. There is room to assess the positivist rule on tadāwī through a general normative vision that I aim to construct in this article. For instance, how can we understand the normative rationale that led Abū Bakr to reject tadāwī? Why is tadāwī not obligatory if the preservation of life is a fundamental normative moral duty in Islamic ethics, as we know from maqās id al-Sharīʿah? How do we reconcile the overarching duty to preserve life and the possibility of withholding or withdrawing medical treatment in EoLC, which would undoubtedly allow death to occur? (cf. Sachedina, 2009, p. 9, 20-29) It is possible to provide some sort of rational justification for the rule on tadāwī and the permissibility of withholding or withdrawing medical treatment by resorting to the notion of mas lah  a (social good). A foundational proposition of Islamic legal theory is that God wills the mas lah  a of humankind. It is a proposition that commands broad consensus across different schools of Islamic theology and jurisprudence, including the traditionally rival schools of Ashʿarites and Muʿtazilites, both of which agree that God's purpose is to promote people's interests (Elmahjub, 2019, p. 318). As a conventional rule of Islamic normative analysis, it serves as the starting point for Muslim juristsboth classic (e.g. ʿIzz al-Dın ibn ʿAbd al-Salām, 1991, p. 10) and modern (e.g. al-Raysuni, 2005, pp. 280-281)who subscribe to maqasid and believe that rulemaking in Islamic law should primarily be informed by choices that promotes the welfare of humankind. The proposition can be interpreted in a purely practical sense as implying a duty to order good and forbid evil, or a broad ethical and normative sense, as in this article.\nIn the latter sense, the proposition is often understood to mean that moral choices should bring about good ( jalb al-manfaʿa) and prevent harm (dafʿ al-ḍ arar). This normative statement is regularly used in Islamic bioethical reasoning to justify decisions in the EoLC environment. Scholars normally engage in consequentialist analysis through empirical observation of a patient's medical conditions and cost and benefit to the public health system. It is often said that medical treatment for a moribund patient is harmful, and expectations of benefits (recovery) are extremely minimal. Accordingly, the right thing to do is to permit acts and omissions that lead to the termination of medical treatment even if this results in certain death (Sachedina, 2009, p. 9, 20-29).\nHowever, this line of reasoning lacks depth. It does not explain why it is permissible to depart from the initial obligation to preserve life and engage in utilitarian analysis of pleasure, pain, cost, and benefit. Medical futility cases are based on a value judgement that death is highly probable and that the expected quality of life, even if the patient is saved, is not objectively satisfactory. Swetz et al. (2014, p. 954) argue that, ultimately, medical judgements remain probable, no matter how great an attempt is made to employ an evidence-based approach to determine futility. How, one may ask, can this value judgement override the foundational Islamic obligation to preserve life, especially considering that human error is also probable in many cases? Indeed, Berge et al. (2005), in their study of errors in the determination of medical futility, found that the margin of error in prognoses could be as high as 23 per cent. While it is generally assumed by those who prioritize consequentialist reasoning that the obligation to preserve human life diminishes in the EoLC, the assumption is not accompanied by adequate moral evaluation. This is the challenge which the present article will seek to address by pondering the scope of this obligation in the EoLC environment.\nIslamic bioethical analysis of EoLC has a limited perception of the kind of futility that permits cessation of medical treatment. Existing deductivist or positivist reasoning does not seem to capture the perplexing uncertainties and situational complexities associated with EoLC. There is no clear vision of the essence of medical futility that would permit acts and omissions terminating a patient's life (Mohiuddin et al., 2020). Does it exclusively depend on the medical prognosis of the expected life span where it would be possible to withdraw medical treatment if doctors predict that the patient has only a short time left to live? Or does medical futility also include patients who might live for an extended period but with a low quality of life? At its core, existing Islamic reasoning on EoLC does not seem to appreciate that medical futility is a highly elusive and moving target. It seems to assume that it involves patients in vegetative states or patients for whom medical treatment has repeatedly failed (e.g. unsuccessful chemotherapy for metastatic cancer).\nMoreover, Islamic bioethical literature typically focuses on a limited range of possible acts or omissions, including withdrawing or withholding ventilators, medicine, or artificial nutrition or hydration. However, medical conditions that could be classified as futile are diverse and more complex. Take, for instance, an 85-year-old patient with advanced dementia who also lives with a pacemaker. They are not on a ventilator and do not require artificial feeding. Physicians cannot provide a satisfactory prognosis for their condition, but they are difficult to treat because of their abusive behavior towards caregivers. Their immediate family members cannot afford the medical treatment and think that the patient has a low quality of life. According to the existing framework of Islamic bioethical reasoning, can the family ask for the patient's pacemaker to be turned off to hasten death? Does the rule on tadāwī and the harm/benefit calculus justify the family's request? What should we prioritize here: the intrinsic value of human life as mandated by the Islamic sources of moral obligation or the consequentialist cost/benefit analysis to minimize suffering and efficiently allocate medical resources to their most effective use?\n\nEoLC and Islamic normative ethics\nThe rest of this article shows that Islamic sources support introducing a broad normative vision for bioethical reasoning regarding EoLC. It engages with Islamic jurisprudence and legal theory not so much as a body of rigid sources of moral obligations but rather as an ethical discourse and a framework for identifying normative principles and justifying ethical judgements. At its core, Islamic jurisprudence and legal theory are concerned with theorizing good and evil, right and wrong, and ultimately seeking answers to the question of morally required conduct for a Muslim in a particular context. There is room for a paradigm shift in the methodology of Islamic bioethical reasoning towards a theory of Islamic bioethics that states and defends principles for morality in the context of EoLCan approach that provides a range of rules to determine at the case level which actions are right, which actions are wrong, what is permitted, and what is forbidden.\nIt is important to reiterate that the proposed paradigm shift in methodology does not seek to challenge the general importance of textual sources in moral reasoning in Islamic legal theory. In the case the legal and ethical questions for which there are specific revelatory injunctions, textual sources are still the first point of reference for creating moral knowledge about the right conduct. However, textual sources have a limited scope of application when it comes to emerging challenges in human societies that were not anticipated at the time of revelation. This explains the conventional wisdom of Islamic jurisprudence al-nusus mutanahiyya wa al-waqaeiʿ ghaiyru muntanahiyya (texts are limited and social change is limitless). This observation is particularly true when it comes to modern bioethical challenges. Textual sources do not provide specific behavioral instructions for the evolving, complex, and vexing moral questions within EoLC in particular. EoLC is an area of moral uncertainty and, as such, it is open to value judgements. If the textual sources cannot enable a direct ethical judgement for bioethical challenges in EoLC, one must adopt an ethical approach to construct normative Islamic principles to justify a moral judgement for EoLC from an Islamic perspective. Premodern Muslim jurists overwhelmingly argued that textual sources are permeated with an overarching vision of mas lah  a, the purpose of which is to establish good and prevent harm (al-Fā sı, 1963, pp. 3-7, 41;al-Ghazālī, 1971, p. 483). This vision operates as a foundational bedrock for moral reasoning in Islamic law and ethics. Jurists would invoke notions of mas lah  a when interpreting and applying existing textual authorities to a particular moral question, extending the law by analogy or engaging in normative analysis to establish norms for textually unqualified issues (al-Raysuni, 2005, pp. 280-281). I aim to develop a unique vision of mas lah  a as a theory of good, ethical value, and right conduct. I view mas lah  a as a normative construct aimed at achieving a moral state of affairs compatible with the divine will, a methodology, and a substantive body of norms, connecting divine intentions, as understood through textual sources, to human good.\nThe vision of mas lah  a I introduce in this article differs from that normally debated in modern literature on Islamic theory. Modern Islamic studies tend to equate mas lah  a with notions like public interest or public welfare, regarding it as a utilitarian concept that aims to minimize harm and maximize good for the greatest number. As I argue elsewhere (Elmahjub, 2021, p. 7), this understanding of mas lah  a does not capture its technical complexity when used as a term of art in Islamic jurisprudence, which is much broader.\nHow, then, is this broad understanding of mas lah  a relevant to EoLC issues? The locus of analysis in EoLC is human life. Mas lah  a, as a theory of good, can provide us with moral insights on the ethical value of human life and how we should formulate normative positions to guide human action when human life is at stake. If the Islamic system of ethics, through its sources of moral obligations, instructs Muslims to seek mas lah  a, what is the essence of mas lah  a that we are trying to protect and promote in the EoLC environment? How do we discover it?\nAs far as the ethical value of human life is concerned, Muslim jurists unanimously agree that preserving human life is an overarching objective of Islamic systems of law and ethics. Human life is intrinsically valuable, and the right conduct lies in preserving life and protecting it against life-threatening dangers. However, there is disagreement about the content that we can give to this expression. My reading of existing Islamic jurisprudence shows that there are two approaches to the normative ethics of human life. There is a deontological approach that views human life as sacred and valuable in its own right. This approach imposes a categorical duty to preserve life regardless of the consequences. The other approach is consequentialist. While it accepts the central value of human life, it determines that the right conduct is that which promotes an optimal state of affairs, even if this leads to sacrificing human life in certain situations.\nIn Sections 4.1 and 4.2, I show how these two approaches could assist in identifying, justifying, and balancing principles for Islamic bioethical reasoning in EoLC. Ultimately, I suggest that the right approach to EoLC ethics lies in a framework that reconciles these two ethical approaches. I call the proposed approach \"Islamic evaluator relativity.\" This approach places Islamic deontology of the ethical value of life as a first-order principle and the rival consequentialist approach as a second-order principle. It then moves to show that the identities of evaluators in the EoLC environment (physicians, patients, and families) should be taken into consideration when balancing options to determine the moral choices in the Islamic worldview.\n\nThe Islamic deontological approach to EoLC\nDeontological normativity holds that what makes conduct morally right is its conformity with preexisting moral norms. A deontologist would argue that each human life is intrinsically valuable as an end in itself. On the normative side, moral agents must obey ethical duties to preserve the intrinsic value of human life. Generally, no other moral data external to the value of life is relevant in determining morally required choices. This includes the quality of human life itself, pain and pleasure, or cost and benefit. Actions not in accord with the intrinsic value of life may not be performed, regardless of our expectations of harmful consequences. In comparative moral philosophy, the central figure of deontological moral theory is Immanuel Kant. He advocates the categorical imperative, which states that it is morally blameworthy for moral agents to treat human life as a means for achieving other purposes. Based on this ethical proposition, a person may not engage (or require others to engage) in acts or omissions to terminate their life in order to end suffering or save costs. Life here has no instrumental value to serve other purposes (Kant, 1785(Kant, /1996. In the Islamic sources of moral obligation, textual norms consistently emphasize the central ethical value of human life. Its protection is highly praised, while its unlawful termination carries the most severe punishment (an eternity in hellfire) (Qurʾān, 5:32, 4:92). In normative terms, it is possible to extract from Islamic jurisprudence a trend that formulates the ethical value of human life in a basic deontological vision. I locate this vision in the writings of Imām al-Ḥ aramayn al-Juwaynī (d. 1085) and Abū H  āmid al-Ghazālī (d. 1111). Both jurists understood Islamic moral reasoning as some form of \"textual deontology\" where revelatory norms act as an exclusive source for ethical value. The right conduct becomes that which accords with a preexisting norm sanctioned by textual sources. In this model, rational, consequentialist, and utilitarian calculations of harm and benefit play no role in norm creation. According to al-Juwaynī, the content of ethical value depends solely on the ethics of revelation. Good (h  asan) and evil (qabīḥ ) do not depend on some intuitionist account of moral knowledge that opens the door for extrascriptural reasoning (al-Juwaynī, al-Burhān fī usụ̄ l al-fiqh, 1980, p. 91). He was probably the first to define mas lah  a as that which revelation intends to achieve (maqṣ ūd al-sharʿ) (p. 48). The scripture is the guide when proclaiming something to be part of the divine scheme as a good that must be promoted or an evil that must be prohibited. The good is that which God declared as good and provided a reward for doing; the evil is that which God declared as evil and ordained punishment for doing (al-Malik, al-Burhān fī usụ̄ l al-fiqh, pp. 1-10).\nAl-Ghazālī shared al-Juwaynī's vision in describing ethical value as maqṣ ūd al-sharʿ. According to al-Ghazālī, revelation promotes an overarching ethical and normative vision agreeable to the interests of humankind (munāsiba). Revelation is designed to enable moral agents (mukallafun) to bring about good and avert evil (al-Ghazālī, Shifāʾ al-ghalīl, p. 221). However, good and evil, as well as benefit and harm, do not depend on human perception, but can be known through textually inspired inductive and deductive surveys. Al-Ghazālī's taxonomy of ethical value identified five primary objectives: the promotion of religion, human life, lineage, intellect, and wealth n.d.,. The ethical value of human life is my concern here. In unmistakeably deontological terms, al-Ghazālī asserts that human life is sacred in its own right. If we have to make a moral choice between (a) respecting our moral duty to individual life or (b) engaging in consequentialist moral analysis to sacrifice it to save a few lives, al-Ghazālī would err on the side of the duty to human life, not the standard utilitarian calculus of achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. This is why he declared as impermissible the act of throwing one passenger from a sinking boat to save the majority. According to al-Ghazālī, the life of that one person is sacred and cannot be sacrificed to the good of the other passengers (p. 489). Although some scholars have sought to explain al-Ghazālī's normative theory in utilitarian terms, notably by focusing on his famous shield example where he stated that it was permissible to kill a few innocent captives used as a human shield if this was the only available option to save a Muslim land and community from invasion (Nusseibeh, 2017, p. 89), there is growing opposition in comparative Islamic studies to this view of al-Ghazali's normative ethics (Elmahjub, 2021, p. 5;Emon, 2005;.Koujah, 2019, p. 136). In sum, the duty to preserve human life takes priority over any consequentialist calculations of cost and benefit, or, as a deontologist would say, the right precedes the good.\nWhat should we make of this deontological Islamic vision of human life when applied to EoLC? The answer depends on how we answer another question: Does the life of a terminally ill person have a moral existence in the Islamic worldview? The answer is a resounding yes! If we set aside scenarios of brain death where Muslim scholars doubt the existence of life itself, the life of a terminally ill person still exists. This is true even if some organ functions depend on external medical support. In this sense, the duty to respect human life does not diminish. This explains why Muslim jurists and institutions have refrained from engaging in consequentialist reasoning about euthanasia and assisted suicide. Considerations of pain and suffering, harm and benefit, and cost to the healthcare system cannot justify a deliberate, intentional act of a physician or the patient to end their life. In this context, Muhammad al-T  āhir ibn ʿĀshūr seems to understand the promotion of life in deontological terms, even if he does not use this term specifically. He contends that it is imperative to protect the life of a poor and sick person suffering from an incurable disease, regardless of the consequences. The value of human life itself cannot be subjected to a cost/benefit or pain/pleasure analysis (al-T  āhir ibn ʿĀshūr, 2001, p. 98, 329).\nThe deontological vision towards the ethical value of human life continues to be binding in EoLC. It imposes a duty on healthcare providers to spare no effort to prevent premature death. This vision also gives the patient the right to receive adequate, reasonable, and appropriate medical treatment. However, it does not transform the obligations of all moral agents in the EoLC context into an absolute moral duty to provide extraordinary, onerous, intrusive, or futile medical treatment. The duty to preserve life does not necessarily become a duty to save life in all circumstances and at all cost.\nThe scope of the duty to preserve life is limited to the best possible performance, not to guarantee results (i.e. keeping patients alive). A physician discharges their duty to protect life if they takes adequate actions to demonstrate the required respect for the sanctity of human life. This should not include providing heroic medical treatment to medically futile cases. Here, we should distinguish between acts and omissions made intending to precipitate death and acts or omissions aimed at removing an impediment. We may not absolutize the Islamic duty to preserve life and transform it into an obligation to heal futile cases and keep patients indefinitely on life-sustaining means. It is hard to accept that the Islamic system of ethics considers as mas lah  a the possibility of keeping a terminally ill patient alive even if this leads to a hardship that is inhumanely imposed. Death is a natural feature of the Islamic worldview. The Qurʾān recognizes this fact and does not depict death as an evil to be avoided in all circumstances (Qurʾān,3:185,67:2,62:8). This probably explains al-Ghazālī's position towards medical treatment for moribund persons. Despite his firm emphasis on a duty-based approach to the sanctity of human life, he was prepared to accept that moribund patients have a legitimate right to refuse medical treatment and allow death to take its natural course (Ih  yāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn, n.d., p. 287). In this context, the deontological vision of Islamic ethics on human life does not necessarily entail categorical prohibitions against withdrawing or withholding medical treatment if rigorously established medical opinions determine that treatment is futile and the patient is terminally ill.\nTo sum up, there is a prima facie general normative principle in Islamic ethics that mandates the preservation of life. This principle remains operational in the EoLC environment unless and until additional moral data about the human life in question enters our field of ethical evaluations. The general bindingness of the duty to preserve life may well be eclipsed by the countervailing need to avoid futile treatment.\n\nThe Islamic consequentialist approach to EoLC\nDeontology is not the only approach that we can see in Islamic ethics. It is possible to view moral reasoning in Islamic jurisprudence and legal theory as a crude form of consequentialist or utilitarian approach to ethics that seeks to maximize value in the EoLC environment. In this sense, moral reasoning moves away from assuming a preformed categorical duty towards preserving individual human life: human life is not always treated as an end in itself. Still, it could be assessed in an instrumentalist way. The right thing to do becomes that which achieves an average good state of affairs that minimizes harm, pain, and inefficient allocation of resources and maximizes benefit, happiness, and the overall good for the majority, even if this leads to sacrificing human life. The general idea of maximizing good and minimizing evil is central to Islamic normative thought. There is a growing trend in comparative Islamic studies that explicitly associates mas lah  a in Islamic theology and jurisprudence with a consequentialist theory of morality, the main purpose of which is to promote the average good in the same way as in standard consequentialist or utilitarian theories (Hourani, 1960, p. 273;March, 2009, p. 63, for whom \"conceptions of mas lah  a are the greatest single example of consequentialistutilitarian reasoning\"). We could extract general consequentialist or utilitarian methodologies from a great number of Muslim jurists (Hallaq, 2009, p. 116;Hallaq, 1997, p. 42, 224;Kerr, 1966, p. 114, 121). However, a few leading examples will suffice, since jurists share the basic consequentialist idea that identifies the intrinsically valuable \"Good\" and seeks choices to increase it. I focus here on Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī (d. 1210), al-ʿIzz ibn ʿAbd al-Salām (d. 1261), and Imām al-Shātị bī (d. 1388) and highlight how their consequentialist methodologies would affect EoLC ethics.\nFor a moral methodology to be branded consequentialist it must be built on two affirmations. First, the metaethical thesis establishes some form of intrinsic ethical value (normally called \"the Good\"). Second, a normative proposition that suggests that morality lies in making choices to maximize that \"Good.\" If we dismantle the methodologies of al-Rāzī, al-ʿIzz, and al-Shātị bī in relation to moral reasoning, we will be able to locate these two affirmations in their contributions.\nIn al-Maḥ ṣ ūl fī ʿilm uṣ ūl al-fiqh, al-Rāzī seems keen to affirm the standard Ashʿarite metaethical claim on ethical value. Our moral knowledge of h  asan (good) and qabīḥ (evil), al-Rāzī asserts, must exclusively be derived from revelation (al-Maḥ ṣ ūl, 1988, Vol. 1 pp. 108, 123). Following the footsteps of al-Juwaynī and al-Ghazālī, he maintains that Muslims need to trace textual commands and prohibitions to form their view on what we would today call ethical value. In this sense, he does not depart from al-Juwaynī's definition of goodness as the purpose of revelation (maqṣ ūd al-sharʿ). Moreover, he not only understood maqṣ ūd al-sharʿ through al-Ghazālī's taxonomy of the five basic social goods but also copied some of al-Ghazālī's practical examples as introduced in al-Mus-taṣ fá (al-Ghazālī's main work on legal theory) (al-Rāzī, al-Maḥ ṣ ūl, 1988, Vol. 5 pp. 160-162).\nHowever, al-Rāzī shifts sharply from the standard Ashʿarite position in his explanation of the content and scope of ethical value. According to al-Rāzī, revelatory norms found in textual sources are associated with design principles agreeable to human nature (munāsiba). He contends that the ethical value intended by God is built on ensuring that all moral agents secure benefit (manfaʿa) and avoid harm (mafsada). Al-Rāzī then reduces the ethical value to a form of rational/hedonic calculation by assimilating manfaʿa with pleasure (ladhdah) and mafsada with pain (alam). According to al-Rāzī, pleasure and pain need no further explanation since both are connected to the individual's sensations (al-Maḥ ṣ ūl, 1988, Vol. 5 p. 158). In other words, good and evil are ultimately discoverable through ontological reasoning as perceived by the human senses. This rational view of ethical value contrasts with al-Juwaynī's and al-Ghazālī's belief in the exclusively textual (and revelatory) source of ethical value and can be assumed to have been inspired by Ancient Greek notions of the hedonic nature of value (Haywood, 1979, p. 266), especially in view of al-Rāzī's claims about the role of pain and pleasure as motivating factors for human actions n.d.,. Our perception of Al-Rāzī's consequentialist/utilitarian approach is consolidated by his normative claims. After determining that ethical value is built on a pain/pleasure calculus, he suggests that the right action depends on a consequentialist weighing of human conduct. If an action brings more good than evil, it becomes imperative, and vice versa (al-Maḥ ṣ ūl, 1988, Vol. 5, p. 278;Vol. 6, p. 166).\nSimilar to al-Rāzī, the overall structure of al-ʿIzz's formula on ethical value and its normative implications supports the consequentialist/utilitarian approach to moral reasoning in Islamic ethics. Al-ʿIzz also makes a metaethical claim about the existence of an intrinsic good as well as a normative claim that the morally required choice is to maximize that good. He begins his discussion on ethical value by insisting that human reason has an ontological capacity to determine the content of mundane interests. Humans are naturally disposed to realize the difference between good and evil. For instance, empirical observation shows that human beings intuitively acknowledge the sanctity of life, property, and honor (al-Qawāʿid al-kubrā, p. 9).\nAl-ʿIzz defines the manifestations of ethical value by declaring that the essence of the good is pleasure and happiness, and the essence of evil is pain and sadness (p. 15). He then draws attention to the complex structure of ethical value by maintaining that pure good and pure evil are rare. Typically, moral reasoning entails degrees of goodness and evilness. Al-ʿIzz's approach to the normative analysis of value is similar to al-Rāzī in holding that the morally required choice depends on a consequentialist weighing of good and evil (p. 12). The right thing to do is to maximize the good (i.e. happiness) and minimize evil (i.e. sadness). However, unlike al-Rāzī, there are different forms of normative positions that we can attach to human actions depending on the relevant degrees of good and evil (p. 15). We cannot reduce moral judgements to mere obligatory acts and omissions. The classic divisions of moral judgement (taqsimāt al-ḥ ukm al-sharʿi) in Islamic legal theory should inform the normative implications that we can attach to ethical value. For instance, pure good leads to obligatory action, pure evil to prohibition, equal expectations of good and evil to permissibility, and so on (pp. 12, 267 et seq.).\nHow might this consequentialist approach apply to Islamic bioethical reasoning in EoLC? It should be noted that al-Rāzī and al-ʿIzz, like al-Juwaynī and al-Ghazālī, believe that preserving human life is a textually mandated objective in Islamic ethics. Therefore, their consequentialism would not open the door to a free-standing utilitarian analysis of EoLC issues. For example, al-Rāzī and al-ʿIzz's model would not permit a departure from the absolute prohibition on euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide to a position whereby these acts are permitted if they lead to reduced pain and suffering and to maximizing the efficient allocation of health resources. However, apart from prohibitions against intentional killings of any sort, their model enables evaluators to seek an overall state of affairs that maximizes pleasure and happiness and minimizes harm and pain, even if, in some cases, this leads to the inevitable outcome of sacrificing individual life. This understanding fits perfectly with al-Shātịbī's vision of Islamic consequentialism. He states that: Instructing humankind to tally the consequences of their actions (ma'ālāt al-'afʿal) is an intended objective of revelation. A jurist (mujtahid) will not arrive at a moral judgement on acts and omissions without giving due consideration to the expected consequences of those acts and omissions. n.d.,Vol. 5,p. 177) Al-Shātị bī applies his formulae of consequentialist reasoning to several examples throughout his book, al-Muwāfaqāt (Vol. 2, p. 27). For instance, he maintains that if we face a situation where we need to decide to choose an action that promotes the good of the majority compared to the interest of the few, we should err on the side of the majority. Accordingly, for al-Shātị bī, the right thing to do is to sacrifice one human life to save the majority (Vol. 2, p. 64). Obviously, al-Shātị bī's reasoning endorses the standard utilitarian position in the famous trolley dilemma: the right thing to do would be to take the action that leads to one person being killed and the rest being saved! We can contrast this position with al-Ghazālī's deontology towards human life where the exact opposite outcome would be achieved (i.e. categorical prohibition to sacrifice life even if the intention is to save many lives).\nGeneral consequentialist reasoning seems to be quite intuitive in mainstream bioethical discourse. We can find its clearest manifestation in the broad normative principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence espoused by Childress and Beauchamp. Consequentialism would be the philosophical parent of these two principles as both are designed to justify choices that lead to avoiding the causation of harm (nonmaleficence) and promoting the optimal balance of benefits against risks and costs (beneficence) (Beauchamp & Childress, 2008, p. 12). Moreover, consequentialist reasoning is at the heart of analytical frameworks that justify medical decisions and policies aiming to maximize the efficient allocation of scarce health resources (Cohen, 1996, pp. 267-272;McKie et al., 1998). EoLC decisions that are made according to these principles and frameworks focus mainly on promoting choices that would reduce pain and suffering and maximize efficient use of healthcare resources. A deontological duty towards life does not usually feature as a prominent consideration.\nThe intuitive appeal of consequentialist reasoning meant that it made its way into Islamic bioethical discourse. The principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence are typically associated with central Islamic maxims such as lā ḍ arar wa-lā ḍ irār (no harm shall be inflicted or reciprocated) and \"No harm, no harassment\" (Sachedina, 2009, p. 47). Islamic institutions that deal with bioethical issues justify their decisions by resorting to consequentialist calculations of benefit and harm and permitting options that maximize benefit for the majority. Within this normative environment, the good and right do not necessarily mean preserving life at all costs. The aim should be to minimize harm and suffering and maximize cost savings even if this leads to forgoing life-sustaining medical treatment (pp. 47, 169-170).\nConsequentialist reasoning is essential for the optimal structure of normative Islamic bioethics. In any given moral situation we face in EoLC, we simply cannot ignore the influence of pain, suffering, and dignity of patients, scarce healthcare resources, and financial and emotional cost to families. We cannot account for these essential considerations without a consequentialist approach to morality. Moral agents in EoLC are not trying to justify decisions to sacrifice human life in ordinary circumstances, nor are they actively seeking artificial inducement of death-hastening conditions. The subject matter for moral interrogations is human life in a terminal stage that is normally subject to constant hardship. Those who would defend the categorical/deontological duty to preserve life might argue that we can sustain life through palliative care (PC) options. Advances in medical sciences enable healthcare providers to prolong the lives of terminally ill patients and alleviate their pain. Thus, our duty should be to use all available means to preserve life. However, PC availability does not necessarily transform our duty to preserve life into an absolute moral norm. PC is not a life-saving process. Accordingly, it would be misleading to suggest that PC can maintain a normal life. In fact, PC itself can produce additional hardships for a dying person. Patients normally undergo trial and error to get optimal PC, and this may lead to additional harm and suffering.\nMoreover, the best available PC does not guarantee complete relief from all pain and suffering. On the contrary, it could impose additional distress on patients in the form of loss of awareness due to sedation or side effects including incontinence and nausea. It is difficult to accept that this significant hardship is compatible with the Islamic normative vision and overall system of ethics, which makes averting hardship an organizing objective for all Islamic norms.\n\nIslamic bioethical relativism\nThe ethical dilemmas of EoLC are complex and defy formulaic applications of given rules to given issues. Therefore, it is essential not to restrict our mode of reasoning to a positivist vision oriented towards looking for specific behavioral instructions and then applying them across the dynamic range of ethical uncertainties in EoLC. As discussed above, Islamic textual sources and jurisprudence provide the basis for an alternative normative vision to address the challenges that we see in EoLC. This alternative normative vision can help us identify and justify moral norms, weigh them against each other, determine their priority, and ultimately apply them to achieve an optimal state of affairs that reflects our intuition of the divine command and human good. If we agree that it is undesirable to absolutize Islamic bioethical reasoning through positivist approaches, the appropriate alternative would be to relativize it through contextual and normative reasoning. Islamic bioethical relativism could influence our thinking about the substantive normative principles of bioethical reasoning as well as the identities of the evaluators/moral agents and their motives. Islamic relativism manifests itself in meshing together the deontological and consequentialist frameworks discussed above and taking note of the relevance of the evaluators' identities in determining the right conduct.\nWhen we consider Islamic jurisprudence as an ethical enterprise, there is no good religious or theoretical reason to think of it as an absolute system of ethics. We are not compelled to accept some philosophical orthodoxy that would lead us to choose between either deontological or consequentialist normativity to justify Islamic ethical value and guide human action. The Islamic system of ethics is best understood as a hybrid system combining both consequentialist and deontological moral positions applicable to any given ethical context (Elmahjub, 2021, p. 27;Moosa, 2014, p. 36). EoLC is an ideal object for this hybrid vision of Islamic ethics. A hybrid theoretical structure that combines various elements of consequentialism and deontology would not be unique to Islamic ethics. It is an essential feature of mainstream bioethical discourse that we can easily locate in the four principles of bioethics. In clear terms, Childress associated himself with Christian deontology while Beauchamp identified himself as a rule utilitarian (1979, p. 40).\nWe can think of the Islamic deontological position towards human life as a first-order principle. As mentioned above, in EoLC settings we are still dealing with human life that has continuous moral existence. Medical diagnoses of terminal illness and futility is based on a probable value judgement that does not change this biological fact and ethical status. Accordingly, Islamic deontic normativity justifies the necessary constraints to reject any active or intentional intervention to end life through euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. It also mandates obligatory safeguards to prevent premature medical decisions to withhold or withdraw medical treatment. Evaluators' behavior is guided to give the utmost respect to the patient's right to life. This could be behaviorally reflected in different ways. For example, we could require unanimous agreement from a multiprofessional team indicating that the patient is in fact \"dying.\" We could also require a minimum period to pass between the decision to stop medical treatment and its fulfilment. Finally, we could require expanding the circle of consultations to include patients and surrogate decision makers. These first-order deontological constraints will be necessary to avoid a quick shift to the end-of-life pathway that appeals to the pragmatism of consequentialist analyses of harm/benefit and resource allocation. An Islamic bioethical approach to EoLC will not allow consequentialism to operate as a first-order principle to override respect for human lifethis can mean tolerating hasty decisions that lead to death. This is particularly worrying for ageing persons, new-borns with disabilities, and persons from a low socioeconomic background (Beauchamp & Childress, 2008, pp. 145-154).\nShifting to a consequentialist/utilitarian methodology would be acceptable if those involved in assessing the ethical status of EoLC demonstrated adherence to the said first-order deontological principle. A blanket adoption of deontology is impractical and indefensible. Only very few extraordinary persons will be able to continue medical treatment for futile cases against all objective medical assessment of terminal illness. This is not necessarily the morally required approach in Islamic ethics. Accordingly, evaluators should be able to extend their analysis to relevant moral data concerning pain, suffering, prospects of recovery, quality of life, and costs to families and healthcare resources. In some cases, it can never be wrong to opt for moral choices that produce an optimal state of affairs, even if this leads to removing impediments so that natural death can take place.\nFinally, we should not ignore the identities of the evaluators as a relevant factor in determining the moral status of Islamic moral judgements in EoLC. This is particularly true for physicians. At its core, EoLC ethics depends on value judgements combining medical expectations and the intuitions of evaluators and their perception of each individual case. It makes sense to relativize moral judgements concerning EoLC to the evaluator's position. An optimal Islamic framework for EoLC bioethics will take into consideration evaluator relativity. Since principal evaluators in EoLC are physicians, our default assumption about physicians is that they are competent moral judges of medical diagnosis and prognosis. They are reasonable, intelligent, informed, and empathetic. They value human life, do not judge prematurely to serve their self-interest, and are unlikely to allow their emotions to cloud their judgements. In Islamic ethics, praiseworthiness and blameworthiness of judgements are significantly tied to agents' intentions and motives (al-Nawawī, 1999(al-Nawawī, -2020. If we take into consideration these assumed traits of physicians as competent moral judges, we should be able to afford them the necessary latitude to exercise their value judgements. In any case, those who pursue Islamic moral judgements in areas of moral uncertainty such as EoLC will not be morally blameworthy according to Islamic ethical norms, so long as they did their best to ensure that their judgement reflected the divine will. When moral choices are formulated as value judgements (amr ijtihādi), the famous Islamic maxim applies so that the evaluator (mujtahid) will be praiseworthy regardless of the choices they make (Ṣ aḥ īḥ al-Bukhārī, Book 96, Hadīth 79, n.d.).\n\nLimitations\nThis research is the first to offer a novel hybrid normative approach to determine the right conduct in matters of EoLC. However, it is not without limitations. In presenting the Islamic worldview on EoLC, the study focuses on leading figures of classic Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence. It does not include inputs from Shia jurisprudence or modern reform figures such as Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida, as their inclusion would have extended the scope of the article beyond reasonable limits. Additionally, this study does not have an empirical component. It would have been helpful to include an empirical study to examine how Muslim physicians, patients, and their families make decisions in connection with EoLC. In particular, does the distinction between Islamic deontological and consequentialist normativity towards human life presented in this article have any practical merit in the decision-making process?\n\nConclusion\nAn optimal framework for Islamic bioethics in EoLC will consider the critical evaluation of existing positivist methodologies. For instance, it is not enough to rely on a posited rule stating that tadāwī is not obligatory and apply this rule to the complicated ethical situations of the EoLC environment. Also, more should be done to explain why it is possible, from an Islamic perspective, to skip the discussion on the sanctity of life as an overarching objective of Islamic morality and view EoLC through the prism of the consequentialist calculation of harm and benefit. There is room to develop a broad Islamic ethical framework to determine the good and the right conduct in EoLC. To do so, we need to start thinking of mas lah  a as a normative construct and ask, What is the mas lah  a that we are aiming to protect in EoLC? Human life is the locus classicus of EoLC ethics. This article argues that, as far as human life is concerned, there are at least two options for expressing and determining mas lah  a in the EoLC context. First, we have a deontological approach that would lead us to demonstrate unconditional respect for the intrinsic value of human life. On the other hand, we have a consequentialist approach that would enable us to tally considerations of pain, harm, costs, and risks. These two approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The right approach to Islamic EoLC bioethics may be found in some hybrid version that combines Islamic deontological and consequentialist thinking towards the moral value of human life.\nAdditionally, it is essential to bring into clearer focus the character and differential particularity of evaluators in Islamic EoLC bioethics. Evaluators in EoLC are competent moral judges. So long as there are adequate safeguards to avoid premature medical decisions of futility and the end of medical treatment, we should afford medical professionals and families the moral discretion to determine the right thing to do. This is particularly true if we have no good reason to doubt the purity of their intentions towards the dying person. Evaluators are not required to seek Islamic ethical justification in any kind of strict harmony between the transcendent realm of preformed ethical norms and moral judgements that reflect divine commands. Rather, they can form a dialectical relationship between Islamic normative principles of deontology and consequentialism. Ultimately, they could seek judgements in the overall meshing of these principles and their intuitions about individual cases.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nFunding\nOpen Access funding provided by the Qatar National Library."

              "A conceptual analysis of how science, religion, and culture interact and influence each other in polities\n\nAbstract One of the nineteenth century’s leading sociologists, Auguste Comte (1798–1857) argued that all political communities—irrespective of geography, race, or ideological inclinations—in their efforts to make sense of the world, pass through similar developmental and evolutionary stages: the religious stage is usually the first, and is followed by the metaphysical stage and later ends in the scientific stage. Weaving from Comte’s paradigms, this paper aims to demonstrate the utility of the interactions among the three study areas of science, religion and culture and the influence that each one of them yields over the others in polity governance. Most significantly, their reciprocal relationship is emphasized. However, one of the pathologies surrounding the study of these three topics is the controversy that they generate among scholars: some researchers argue that science is a stand-alone concept, which should be delinked from the other two knowledge-seeking endeavors. The ground for their argument is that unlike religion and culture, scientific premises are—in principle—falsifiable. Other scholars argue to the contrary: that there is, in fact, a close connection among the three study areas, which helps to sustain human life. In bridging these research trajectories, this paper argues in favor of the latter argument, which acknowledges the reciprocal roles that each one of these endeavors play in enhancing the others. This position is also in synchronicity with Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s standpoint that the ontology of human nature is best understood from the prism of integration, adaptation, and cooperation rather than from competition and contestation. Although the comparative analysis of the three study areas reveals both the homogeneities and contrasts among them, the study concludes that science, enriched with philosophical underpinnings from culture and religion offers the best radar for optimal social development. In discussing the issues articulated, this paper adopts a mixed method of enquiry consisting of both the quantitative and qualitative methods. The paper also draws on secondary methods of enquiry through academic journals, scholarly books, and online publications.\n\n\nPUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT\nThis study examines how science, culture, and religion influence each other in shaping societal dispositions. To achieve this, the study takes a transdisciplinary approach, which disbands the boundaries between these conventional disciplines and attempt to (re)construct their meaning in the context of real-life enigmas. On the one hand, science lends its utility from pragmatic and experimental approaches that may employ a variety of empirical methods and technological approaches such as computational methods, data archiving and artificial intelligence: this is how science interprets world phenomenon. On the other hand, the ontology of culture and religion spins on hermeneutics, rhetorical, and historical approaches as guides in the interpretation of world occurrences: the philosophy of culture and religion assumes that epistemology is incomplete if it ignores history.\nWhile this cultural and religious epistemological underpinning cannot be dismissed as idle speculation, societies must be wary of the snares of blanket reliance on history as an unchanging database for evaluating societal premises and insights. Similarly, scientific novelties must equally be scrutinized as some of them do not lend themselves to ethical designs. The overall context of this study's argument is that due to the contingency nature of life situations, it is imperative to pay attention to when and how the meanings of some of the key societal notions are undergoing transformation.\n\nIntroduction\nThis paper aims to make a reciprocal connection and appreciation of the study areas of science, culture, and religion. The research question that the paper sought to answer is: how does science, culture and religion interact and influence each other? To appreciate their interplay and interface, the paper provides a brief description or definition of each one of them. This way, the nuances and premise upon which their influences are built will be grasped more fully. Most significantly, due to their distinctiveness, they also operate as forms of 'checks and balances' on each other-thereby building upon each other. In deliberating these research configurations, certain passages in this paper will use religion and culture interchangeably due to their close relationship in their practical application in society.\n\nWhat is science?\nScience may be defined as a systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through objective observation, experiment, verification, and falsification processes. Science is an enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable and reliable explanations and predictions about the universe (Rosenberg, 2005). Science may also be defined as a branch of knowledge dealing with a body of facts that are systematically arranged and showing operation of general laws. Science encourages truth and understanding of events by exposing its processes to scrutiny and peer review assessment. Science is a result of revolutionary interaction-revolutions challenge the status quo and expand levels of human imagination.\nScience also develops cumulatively and incrementally. This ultimately injects a mindset of critical thinking in its processes. In science, truth is something that can be tested and proved (ibid). According to William Whewell, a scientist is any practitioner of diverse natural philosophies (Whewell, 1834).\n\nWhat is culture?\nThe concept of culture and values are complex with no clear ideological consensus among scholars. The United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (1945) defines culture as a 'set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of a society, which encompasses value systems, tradition customs and beliefs in the areas such as in the arts, literature, lifestyles, and ways of living together.' According to Woodhead (2011), culture can be defined as the characteristics of a group of people described by a common language, common bonds, common beliefs, family ties, religion, shared life, and social habits. Culture may also be defined as a set of ideas, rules, arts, customs, laws, customary beliefs, and norms including material objects commonly practiced by a group of people that can be used to define them as a collective. Culture can also be seen as a symbol of group identity, monuments, style of dress, flags, and distinctive foods and a general agreement on what the collective considers to be societal values. Expanding on these categories, culture is made up of common sense, assumptions, and certain expectations. Here, truth is something that emanates from normative assumptions and moral judgements (Prinz, 2012).\n\nWhat is religion?\nScholars offer varied definitions. Religion may be defined as a social-cultural system of designated behaviors, practices, morals, beliefs, prophesies, ethics, and world views that relates humanity to the supernatural and spirit rudiments. Idinopulos (1998) would define religion as a unified system and practices of worship, faith, sacred ceremonies, a belief in God as the supreme supernatural being. Religion may also be defined as a social system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, world views, ethics, prophesies, and institutions that relate humanity to supernatural elements. Other scholars could define religion an organized collection of beliefs, cultural systems and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence. Religions have narratives, symbols and sacred histories that are intended to explain the meaning of life or the origin of life. Religions are comprised of a set of feelings, dogmas and practices that define the relations between the human being and the holy, the sacred, the spiritual and the divine. Under religion, truth is derived from beliefs of the supernatural and divine elements (Hammer, 2019).\nReligion as a cultural system comprises myths, rituals, and beliefs as a way of creating a sense of meaning in the lives of human beings. Woodhead (2011) argued that although faith is linked to belief in unseen realities, people have always wanted to see the sacred. As such, rituals work as tangible symbols of the intangible realm. Rituals not only denote spiritual truths but also outline how power is comprehended in the material world. Sacred stories of important historical events also form part of the religious belief system.\n\nMethodology\nThis study aimed at assessing the interplay of science, culture, and religion in advancing the human knowledge. The research question that the paper sought to answer is: how does science, culture and religion interact and influence each other? The research, therefore, lies within the realm of these three specific relationships. The instruments used for empirical data collection were both quantitative and qualitative methods.\nQuantitative methods were employed to justify the use of statistical information. However, more data were collected from qualitative methods, such as through the following: (a) from the landmark court rulings of the Dutch Supreme Court, and the Hague District Court (b) from a report from the United Nations (UN) climate summit, the UN Economic Commission for Africa, (c) from speeches and excerpts from men of letters and prominent personalities. Other forms of information that supported the evidence in the study were gathered from secondary sources such as from academic journals, scholarly books, and online publications. This mixed method approach of data collection was employed for the purpose of cross-checking information to ensure that data collected were harmonized (Crewell, 1990).\n\nConceptual issues-science, culture and religion\nThroughout history, the relationship of science, culture and religion has always offered a mixed bag of reactions and competition because all of them keep evolving and are divergent across cultures. Science and religion emerged to prominence at different times (Draper, 1874). Religion emerged to greater heights in the 1600s, while science became more prominent in the 1800s. One of the ways in which science can be distinguished from religion stems from the claim that science concerns only the natural world, while religion encompasses both the natural world and the supernatural. More specifically, scientific theories do not lend themselves to supernatural entities such as gods, angels, karma, miracles, magic, and witchcraft. Their differing assumptions have been twofold; whereby on the one hand, we have conflicting assumptions, and on the other hand, the harmonizing assumptions. A major point of observation is that prior to the scientific revolution, scientific inventions were conducted by communities under religious traditions (White, 2009).\nScholars such as Karl Popper see the relationship between science, culture and religion as different entities attempting to address different things (Rees, 2017). Also, scientific language and religious language are at variance. Scholars in the category of Popper argue that religion and culture are corrosive to science and vice-versa and as such, each should stay in its own domain (Popper, 1959). It is argued that the historical pedigree of religion and culture is notorious for nurturing orthodox conceptions of lifestyles, which result in the (re)production of distorted images and identities of individual talent and acumen in the polity development discourse. Ethologist Richard Dawkins posits that science need not accommodate religious and cultural beliefs because religion degrades the scientific enterprise by weakening and undermining the intellect. Further, the rigid disposition of religious norms tends to make the converted followers susceptible to chauvinist effusions that often lead to radicalization and religious fanaticism, which otherwise could be described as the blind devotion to a particular cause (Dawkins, 2002).\nReligious fanaticism and extremism have often high ability to use applied science and are not confined to a particular religion or culture. The misleading postulation that assumes, for instance, that religious fanaticism is necessarily linked to violence or terrorism, is a narrow conception which overlooks the wider sphere within which radicalism, extremism and fanaticism is situated. For instance, the Christian fanfare regularly exhibited by some Pentecostal evangelists where they organize so-called 'healing rallies' and 'healing conferences' where they supposedly perform 'prosperity and healing miracles', and where some attendees 'speak in tongues', and others falling to the ground upon being touched or anointed by the evangelist, is-from a prism of a scientist-a form of religious fanaticism. In Pakistan, for instance, honor killings, otherwise the cold-blooded murders, often of women for alleged violations of conservative norms that administer (marital) relationships have continued despite the 2016 Pakistan national legislation that prescribes stiff prison sentences for such killings. From a perspective of science, such cultural practices would be classified as acts of cultural fanaticism (The Guardian, 24 May 2022). To appreciate further the expanded scope of religious and cultural fanaticism, another example involving an Islamic organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, will be used: internationally, the movement is perceived to be a radical and extremist organization with violence-predisposed religious blueprints. The West, in particular, argue that the groups' maneuvers and its mobilization strategy-to all intents and purposes-point to an organization that positions itself as a fertile incubator of terrorist activities. To the contrary, within their local jurisdictions, the Muslim Brotherhood is generally viewed in a positive light as an organisation that promotes charity works, community welfare ventures, and disseminates Islamic values of social justice (Vannetzel, 2017).\nAn analysis of the educational background of key figures within the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood suggest that majority of them have attained high qualifications such as in the natural science fields of biology, engineering, technology, and earth science. Several other officials hold degrees in the social and human sciences. Paradoxically, only a handful within their leadership ranks have qualifications in religious studies (Vannetzel, 2017). The question that one might ask is: how does a person who is skilled in the analysis of empirical data turn out to be a religious fundamentalist? On face value, one would be inclined to assume that the efficacy of science itself would eliminate fanatical views. However, two of the following analyses might provide answers to this paradox: (1) The absence of societal freedoms: Polities that promote freedom in their communities also intrinsically expand the horizons of critical thinking, and hence diminish rigid and orthodox thinking. In restrictive societies, science may be exploited and utilised as a tool that validates absolute and inflexible religious attitudes. More bizarrely, rigid societies also tend to impose their dogmatic beliefs on other people; believing in simplistic notions that people are either with them, or against them, i.e., the tendency to view scenerios only in black and white versions.\n(2) Religious entities provide incentives, prestige, and privileges to elite members: Due to the inherent linear thinking, religious institutions prefer to attract the scientific elite to propel the religious agenda. This is because science yields enormous influence in society. This influence means that scientific knowledge pauses tremendous threat to religious authority, hence the calculated moves to entice scientific scholars. This might explain why, for instance, the Muslim Brotherhood relied on the elite science scholars as leaders. With scientists on board, the religious project gains significant traction. It can be argued, however, that the practical or real scientific contributions of these science scholars to the wider (global) scientific family remains negligible. This shows that the scientific elites in extremist organisations may only serve as superficial garments that provide effervescence to organizations that are engrossed in ideological positivism (Vannetzel, 2017). Dawkins (2002) points out that given that culture and religion makes claims of the supernaturalclaims which science refutes-the incompatibility could not be clearer, and further opines that: . . . culture and religion teach people to believe in trivial, supernatural non-explanations that we have within our grasp. Religion teaches people to obey authority, revelation, and faith instead of insisting on evidence . . .\n\nKarl\nPopper would further argue that philosophers of science must delineate science from other knowledge-seeking endeavors such as religion because unlike religion and culture, the utility of scientific theories depends largely on their ability to be falsified (Popper, 1959). Neurologists (scientists), for instance, normally explain human thoughts in terms of the state of the brain, instead of referring to the soul or to the spirit, which is what religion and culture does. Put simply, science helps to identify causal mechanisms of phenomenon that are both verifiable and falsifiable (Forrest, 2000).\nThe melting point of this incompatibility argument can be traced back to the days of Nicolas Copernicus and Galileo who found themselves at loggerheads with the powerful catholic church at the time for advocating heliocentrism-a scientific concept that argued that the sun, not the earth, was at the center of the universe (White, 2009). The Pope denounced this conception arguing that it contradicted the teachings of the church; in those days, the architecture, muzzle, and influence of the Catholic Church on polity affairs papered over the cracks. It is contended that the major difference between science, culture and religion is that in science, explanations are expected to be evidence-based. Scientific experiments that disagree with an explanation must either be amended or may require that the explanation altogether be ended. In religion and culture, on the other hand, teachings do not rely on empirical evidence and cannot be modified in the face of conflicting evidence because they lean on divine and supernatural powers. As White (2009) has contended, given that divine matters are not part of nature, it is, therefore, not possible for science to investigate them. In this connection, it can be contended that science and religion are separate since they address crucial aspects of human grasp in different, if not entirely in opposing ways. Thomas Kuhn opined that people in different paradigms cannot speak the same language and even where communication is possible, scientists, on their part, will use a different standard of evidence and argument evaluation (Kuhn, 2012).\n\nThe differing perspectives within the scientific body-Positivism, Logical Positivism, Post-Positivism, and Marxism\nScientific perspectives themselves have taken opposing views: for instance, positivism which came to prominence in the nineteenth century was championed by Auguste Comte, and later refined by Emile Durkheim, stressed that empiricism and objectivity were crucial anchors in knowledge formation. The positivist standpoint was that knowledge is derived from sensory information relying on the scientist as an objective medium. In addition, positivism regarded the natural sciences as the only real sciences; in this context, the social sciences fell outside that framework on the understanding that social sciences derive their knowledge from subjective experiences of people. Put simply, the knowledge obtained from societal attitudes could not have an objective basis (Moses & Knutsen, 2007).\nBy the early twentieth century, logical positivism emerged and challenged the idealist knitting of positivism and took an anti-idealist stance towards science. Among those who propelled logical positivism was Moritz Schlick, a leading figure of an influential scientific grouping at the time, the Vienna Circle. The main point of departure was that whereas Comte's positivism saw a transitional connection from religion, metaphysics, and science, logical positivism did not recognise that connection, hence rejected a core underpinning of positivism. Logical positivism's central argument was that single observations (which were acceptable under positivism) are not enough and cannot always be relied upon as they are prone to subjectivity. Instead, logical positivism proposed verification and triangulation as the alternative method of scientific enquiry (Moses & Knutsen, 2007).\nHowever, towards the 1930s, post-positivism philosophers such as D.C. Phillip and Karl Popper emerged and challenged logical positivism almost entirely. In the ensuing years, Popper remained the dominant figure of the post-positivist agenda whose main point of disapproval of logical positivism was that scientific knowledge is always provisional; that in experiments, verification is not a sufficient means to disprove a supposition; and that no number of positive outcomes could confirm a theory, yet a single refutation is logically decisive. For Popper, scientists are never objective because observation is 'theory-laden' -the world appears to us in the context of theories we already hold.\nThe two pictures below help to illustrate Popper's argument in the context of the intrigues of a human mind and its susceptibility to subjective views. In the first picture, one supposition might hold the view that a Zebra is white with black stripes, yet another opposing belief could suggest that a Zebra is in fact black with white stripes (Figure 1).\nWith reference to the second picture, one line of thought might posit that the image shown is a tumbler, yet an alternative viewpoint could argue to the contrary and suggest that in fact the image represents two people looking at each other at close range.\nPost-positivism takes a social constructivist perspective that contends that not everything is completely knowable. This position sits germane with the views of former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's political allegory, unknown unknowns which he expounded at the height of the 2003 Iraq war saga. In his allegory, the point that Rumsfeld was driving was that 'there are many things (or hidden activities) of which we are so unaware that we do not even know that we are unaware of them' (Rumsfeld, 2011).\nComing to the emergence of post-positivism, Popper replaced the positivist classical 'inductivist disposition' with the theory of falsification as an alternative and solid method of scientific enquiry, arguing that this technique demarcated science from non-science. Popper's key philosophical contribution was the proposition that progressive science must endeavour to disprove a theory rather than seek solace in attempts that continuously support the prevailing theoretical hypotheses. The notable scientists that followed Popper's work and who have furthered his insights are Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend. Thomas Kuhn's thought of the paradigm shifts in science further neutralised the theoretical pillars of logical positivism (Kuhn, 2012).\nSo, by the beginning of the second half of the twentieth century, positivism had waned, and took a moderate position, which was named as, logical empiricism, championed by logician Carl Hempel. To remain relevant, Hempel preferred to adopt the phrase, 'logical empiricism' as opposed to maintaining 'logical positivism' because the latter carried undertones of metaphysical propositions whose hypotheses are not capable of confirming or disconfirming the evidence presented (Popper, 1959).\nThe innovative conception of these old debates, particularly those of Comte and Popper, has provided seminal scientific foundations upon which contemporary scientists and philosophers are drawing and building broader scientific constellations.\nScientific inquiry thrives mainly in polities that foster the free flow of ideas and information: culture and religion-due to their dogmatic disposition-rarely provide environments for the free flow of ideas and innovation. Crucially for the global south, and Africa in particular, the dynamics of the twenty-first-century ideas of development depend on the intellectual, free, and open discussion of recurrent developmental challenges of governance, industrialization, education, and technology. From this analysis, it can be deduced that today, majority of countries that are thriving are those that promote free-thinking and are forward-looking (Vorvornator, 2022).\nSociologists such as Durkheim argued that religious beliefs are only intended to serve the purpose of creating a harmonious societal environment to keep communities together. Like Durkheim, critical theorists such as Max Weber and Karl Marx held the view that religion would decline in the face of the growth of science and technology (Rees, 2017). It is also not a coincidence that most poverty-stricken polities tend to be more religious than affluent societies-many poor people hold fallacy religious views that their economic doldrums would improve with divine or supernatural intervention. As Karl Marx put it, 'religion is the opium of the people'. Marx's contextual 'opium' metaphor is very instructive: it challenges the population to put a premium on practical and sustainable economic models that have the capacity to alleviate poverty rather than focus on religious convictions as solutions (Pedersen, 2015).\nSo, how does Marxism relate to this study topic? The utility of the Marxist theory here is that it infuses a critical theory perspective in its influences that helps to guide our understanding of the disposition of economic relations and its residual effects of class conflict. Marxism blends with critical theory ideas of the Frankfurt School scholars such as Jurgen Habermas and Max Weber whose aim is to unravel conditions for social change. In doing so, Marxism unmasks the obscured misconceptions of some societal ideologies and assumptions that keep the population from truly understanding how the economic systems work against them, in a counterfeit fashion. Marx puts this economic debate in perspective when he argues that: . . . as participants in a capitalist market economy, we fall into thinking of the economy in terms of private property rights, free exchange, the laws of supply and demand, etc. . . . and in doing so, we fall into thinking of capitalist economic social relations as justified, as how things should be. This way of thinking is nothing but an ideology: it obscures, even from those people who suffer them, the pervasive and destructive forms of alienation, powerlessness and exploitation that define capitalism's economic relations. Any prospects for change, reform or revolution requires first that people come to see capitalism for what it is; for they must first see the ways in which they themselves are alienated, powerless and exploited before they can try to free themselves from it (Koltonski, 2014).\nThese Marxist revelations are critical to societal emancipation because they further expose the fact that knowledge levels at global level are biased and compromised. For instance, world philosophy and science are dominated by Western scholarship as if the global south did not have reservoirs of rich scientific and philosophical conceptions. It is certain that not every one agrees that the West is the only place in the world that produced scientific and philosophical knowledge. To be sure, the global south has always had prowess in scientific ventures, but their skills have been subdued for centuries at the hands of imperial and colonial powers (Simuziya, 2021). Specifically, on Africa, the African question in science and philosophy remains mysterious because of the intentional effort by the colonial project to rationalize Africans out of humanity. Eurocentric scholars maimed African history and invented a false image of an African which they presented as the substantive African identity. Famous Western scholars such as G.W. Hegel, David Hume and Charles de Montesquieu gave weight to the idea that Africans are inferior compared to Western races (Uduma, 2014). A more apt description of this exploitation and marginalization of African scholarship is laid bare when Uduma (2014) argues that: . . . the colonialists concocted an image and identity of Africans that present them as prelogical, barbaric, and as such, incapable of having philosophical thoughts. This identity was foisted and consolidated on humanity including on Africans themselves, and intellectually accepted as the true African identity for over four centuries. Consequently, while the racist Eurocentric description of the African makes it impossible for one to suggest that there can be anything like African science and philosophy, the enslavement, balkanization, colonialization, and the introduction of a Western-oriented form of education into Africa further dehumanized, traumatized, and alienated Africans from their culture. This experience is what precipitated the identity problem in Africa.\nFrom the African continent, the civilization of ancient Egypt is evidence that the continent possessed unique aptitude of scientific and philosophical workings. These include the traditional African medicines and healing plants whose compositions today are clandestinely syphoned to the West without providing sufficient acknowledgement that these medicinal plants are in fact indigenously African (Simuziya, 2021).\nFrom Asia, the ancient teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius have had profound influence on the development of the Chinese people. So, both the Asian and African examples bear witness to the fact that scientific and philosophical knowledge is not a preserve of the West. Also, the fact that the West itself occasionally-reluctantly though-refers to ancient Egypt and to the Confucius studies as sources of knowledge confirms that tanks of scientific knowledge from the global south have long provided valuable human knowledge beyond their continental borders (Taam, 1953).\nComing to religion, Kenyan law professor Patrick Lumumba is in synchroneity with the view that religious dogmas pose a potential detrimental effect on the economic growth prospects of Africa when he argues that 'Africans are notoriously religious' believing that prayers will bring economic revival. Professor Lumumba observes that this simplistic understanding, and over-the-top dramatization of religious scripts is fundamentally flawed and only works to perpetuate poverty in (African) societies: many religious Africans have tended to grasp religious doctrines out of context. Like Karl Marx, Professor Lumumba's allegorical reference of Africans being 'notoriously religious' is equality informative as it exposes the widespread deficiency of reflective reasoning in religious circles on how economic growth can be attained (Lumumba, 2020).\nThe utility of religion in the context of economic emancipation (particularly in Africa) is further put into question when an African scholar Ousma Touray argues that: . . . when we (Africans) analyze the systems that we have today . . . spirituality for instance, has been narrowed down to religion. Religion promises us unity, love, kindness, trustworthiness, health, and heaven (abundant life) -but are these the living reality of the religions that we belong to in Africa today? Are we (the Africans) united as a continent? Are we trustworthy as individuals? Are we patriotic as Africans, and are we ready to build (economic) growth solutions for the continent? If (harmony and abundance) is the promise of religion, do the facts on the ground across the continent reflect a living reality of those religious promises? (Touray, 2021).\nOn the other hand, however, scholars who see a silver lining in the compatibility argument (i.e., those who claim that religion and science are in harmony), have cautioned that scientific grandstanding over cultural and religious enquiries need self-moderation: they argue that all knowledge is personal and therefore the scientist must be performing a personal (and hence a subjective) mission when conducting research . . . scientists merely follow intuitions of 'experimental agreement'. Further, for science to be sustained, it needs moral guidance and obligations like those found in culture and religion (Harrison, 2015). Scholars in this category see a close relationship between science, religion and culture and consider this relationship to be harmonious. In general, however, most religious scholars see science as being complementary to their beliefs while at the same time acknowledging that there are conflicts on methodology. Likewise, scientists who are religious also see this compatibility (Lama, 2005).\nIronically, although natural philosophers such as Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton had the tendency to favor philosophy (and science), nevertheless were also keen to explore the supernatural in their (scientific) works. This revelation confirms that each one of the three topics under discussion advances the frontiers of scholarship on the ontology of polity governance (Forrest, 2000).\nHistorian, Peter Harrison argues that biblical teachings have in fact been instrumental in providing building blocks for modern science and that theological conceptions of nature and humanity helped to give rise to science; hence, there are colorations and compatibilities (Harrison, 2015). This position is also supported by a survey that was carried out in the USA in 2009 to find out the percentage of scientists who are religious. The survey suggests that at least 33% of scientists at the material time were religious. The diagram below (Figure 2\n\nExcesses of science and how they are mitigated by cultural and religious underpinnings\nIn contemporary IR, the excesses of science can be seen in major technological innovations. Science, which is usually driven by an insatiable appetite to enhance the engineering, mechanical, technical, medical, and social efficiency of global systems is not always able to apply its innovations in ways that lend themselves to ethical designs. The pathologies of modern science are more aptly explained by Podvoyskiy (2022) when he argues that: . . . technology is 'fetishized' by the modern thinking . . . excessive specialization, standardization, algorithmization, routinization of activities, technological and functional operationalization of the work process and professional roles, the dominance of means over goals, administrative and bureaucratic regulation and control have become 'signs of the time' and distinctive features of the 'rhythm of activity' not only in industrial enterprises, but also in non-physical labor. An important aspect (and background circumstance) in the diagnosis of modernity is the fact that in recent centuries, modern societies have developed mainly in the urban social-ecological environment . . .\n\nFigure 2. Religious beliefs among scientists in the United\nStates of America. Simuziya, Cogent Social Sciences (2022) For instance, artificial intelligence systems such as video surveillance and biometric tracking are increasingly being used today to monitor, track, and thwart (suspected) criminal and terrorist activities. While these measures might help to improve security, they do violate the privacy of ordinary people. Most notably, these gages could potentially aid future discriminations (using stored surveillance data) based on ethnic affiliations, race, religious beliefs, and political ideologies (Cataleta & Cataleta, 2020).\nThree of the following examples provide telling instances of these gaps in science and how the philosophical foundations embedded in culture and religion offer the necessary remedies.\n(1) On 6 February 2020, the Hague District Court ordered the Dutch government to stop the use of the SyRI, an automated system that analyses a wide range of personal and sensitive data to predict how likely people are to commit tax or benefits fraud. The court ruling affirms that individuals who need social security support should be treated as rights-holders whose privacy matters, and not suspects to be constantly surveilled. The court argued that transparency is needed to guard against such technology-enabled abuses of privacy and related rights (Human Rights Watch, 2020). During the hearing, the government representatives failed to provide evocative information about how SyRI uses personal data to draw inferences about such possible fraud. The court was dissatisfied that government officials had to hide how the system's risk calculation model works. But to counter the court's concerns, the government argued that the SyRI does not automatically trigger legal consequences or even a full investigation. But even this argument failed to dispel the courts' concerns that the SyRI risk-scoring process itself created significant potential for abuse. Under the SyRI system, the court argued, individuals have no way of knowing or challenging their risk scores, which are stored in government databases to which they have no access. Human Rights Watch (2020) points out that the court further argued that: . . . without (access to) this information, it is nearly impossible for individuals under suspicion to challenge the governments' decisions to investigate them for fraud. This lack of transparency is particularly troubling given that SyRI has been exclusively deployed in so-called 'problem' neighborhoods -a potential proxy for discrimination and bias based on individuals' social-economic backgrounds and immigration status . . .\nThe court's ruling justifies the efforts of human rights campaigners to ensure that due diligence is given to the design of automated decision-making systems. Claims by government representatives that a single data protection impact assessment that it conducted for the SyRI was enough attracted further rebuke from the court; the court argued that this on-size-fits-all assessment may have overlooked the need to conduct similar assessments for each municipal-level project that adapted SyRI to its specific fraud detection needs (Human Rights Watch, 2020).\nBy stopping SyRI, the court has drawn a line in the sand-that such technological innovations must be sensitive to moral values, ethics, and human rights, particularly the rights of the poor in the age of automation. Other governments such as the US and the UK that have relied on data analytics to regulate access to social security should heed the Dutch court's warning about the human rights risks involved in treating social security beneficiaries as perpetual suspects.\nAlthough artificial intelligence as a cognitive technology has the capacity to improve human lives, it also has profound penalties for societies and cultures. Some of the social pathologies could be in forms of enticing alienation (i.e., subjugating people from a position of the subject to the position of object in social relations), increasing misinformation, aggravating existing imbalances and inequalities and the consequences for human rights.\n(2) Some of the powerful nations of the global north in their pursuit for industrial growth have failed to fully implement the 1997 Kyoto protocol that seek to limit gas emissions to mitigate the effects of climate change. The US in its desire for unfelted technological advancement has gone a step further in its defiance by renouncing the Paris Climate Treaty of 2017. The worst culprits of emissions at global level are regions of North America, Asia, and the EU (Nwankwo, 2019). Climate change affects ecological patterns that may create conflicts in certain areas. Conflicts related to these challenges could be likened to the case in the Darfur region of Sudan, where the scarcity of grazing land led to conflicts to the scale of genocide over pastoral land. African states have called on the US to scale down its emissions as the impact of climate change affects people of the global south much more than those of the global north. Effects of climate change are varied and may include acid rain, global warming, and biodiversity loss (Dunn & Shaw, 2001). So, climate change issues have come to shape African orientation to global governance with demands for more equitable inclusion in multilateral structures.\nThe 2009  . . . we (Africans) will never accept any global deal that does not limit global warming to the minimum unavoidable level, no matter what levels of compensation and assistance are promised to us . . . while we will reason with everyone to achieve our objective, we will not rubberstamp an agreement by the powers that be as the best we could get for the moment. We will use our numbers to delegitimize any agreement that is not consistent with our minimal position. If needs be, we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations that threaten to be another rape of our continent . . . This confirms that stronger African philosophical and cultural claims for environmental justice against the biggest environmental culprits should not be understated. This statement also signals the deep resentment that Africans have on neo-imperialist tendencies such as unfair trade deals and the use of hard-power politics (particularly by the US) as opposed to the use of soft power politics approaches. On the flip side of the coin however, it can be argued that the options and influence of the African states are limited and decisions at regional or continental level remain hard to take due to Africa's weak industrial capacity. For instance, Ethiopia's hardline stance and a demand for a different sequencing for developing nations is-in the long run-curtailed by the fact that the US provides Ethiopia with funds to support its growing textile industry under the US initiative program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (Cornelissen et al., 2012).\nThe diagram below (Figure 3)illustrates the carbon emissions that disadvantages Africa.\nOn 20 December 2019, the Dutch Supreme Court made a groundbreaking ruling by ordering the government of The Netherlands to reduce greenhouse emissions by at least 25% (Fortune Daily News, 20 December 2019).\nThis landmark court ruling could have similar repercussions across the world. On passing judgment, the court argued that climate change is part of the human rights discourse and as such, failure by the Dutch government to adhere to the UN Climate Convention guidelines was inconsistent with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention on Human Rights, 1950). This ruling is a fatal blow below the belt to other governments such as the US which continue to refuse to respect international treaties on climate change. Human rights campaigners have applauded the ruling as it has the potential to inspire similar lawsuits in other countries (Fortune Daily News, 20 December 2019).\nThe significance of the Court interventions mentioned above is that laws are largely derived from cultural and religious conceptions but are not limited to these conceptions-laws also get insights from scientific innovations. This way, laws operate as a balancing act to \"weed\" out excesses from any discipline.\n(3) Literary professor Lionel Trilling provides a comparison of how polities in the past centuries were held together by the commitment of people fulfilling their posts in life, whether they were craft workers or moguls: unlike in the past, people in contemporary societies are obsessed with the culture of authenticity-a self-centered preoccupation that spins on cutthroat contests-as a quality of life and criterion of art. For instance, to rise to the top in most science-related fields today such as medicine, political philosophy, engineering, economics and Information Technology, people tend to equate the dog-eat-dog type of output competition with high quality-believing that in the fight for success, the best ideas (coming at any cost) will be the ones that will shine (The Conversation, 2022). However, such competitions entail a zero-sum noncooperative mindset that seldom drives excellence, hence renders the enterprise counterproductive. More damningly for the UN gender and equality project, societal stereotype often equates brilliance with men. Competition is not a bad thing, but in this context, everyone suffers in a culture focused on attaining status and dominance at any cost. Adejuwon Soyinka summarized this new age of technological discrepancy when he said: . . . workplaces that emphasize brilliance are perceived to have a masculine work culture which undermines gender diversity due to the ruthless competition that glorifies traits such as aggression. Traditionally, women are taught to be modest, kind, and cooperative, so, such aggressive and competitive work atmospheres might ultimately not appeal to women. To thrive and succeed in so-called modern and technologically driven workplaces, employees must appear tough, conceal any weaknesses, put work above all else, be ready to step on others, and constantly watch their backs . . . (The Conversation, 2022).\n\nExcesses of culture and religion and how they are mitigated by scientific underpinnings\nHarmful cultural and religious practices such as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) which are still practiced in some parts of Africa particularly in West Africa, and the practice (in some countries of the Middle East) of stoning women to death (women who commit adultery), and honor killings cannot be justified in contemporary IR theory or in international jurisprudence. These outmoded and otherwise primitive practices of the Victorian times have no place in contemporary human rights discourses of the twenty-first century. Such cruel treatment of women under the banner of religion, culture, and national sovereignty is not only a transgression of international human rights laws but also against religious norms themselves-religious teachings emphasize forgiveness and repentance (Kusha & Ammar, 2014). These practices amount to violence against women because they violate the tenets enshrined in international human rights protocols, which are sanctioned by the UN such as the Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, 1979) and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (1948).\nDonnelly (2013) defines human rights as rights that are equal, inalienable, and universal, even with considerations of cross-cultural relativism. The main argument here is that human rights are not culturally relative because culture is not the cause or a factor in the development of human rights practices. Donnelly (2013) further opines that the primary sense of universality is not merely compatible with but necessarily includes an essential element of relativity. The question, therefore, is not whether human rights are universal or relative, but how human rights are. To put it another way, human rights transcend cultural and religious boundaries. In this age of science and technology, there are better ways of providing remedies for those who are accused of wrongdoing. Religious people claim that God is merciful-so, if this claim is indeed valid, one must wonder then how a merciful God would be pleased to see women being stoned to death.\nHowever, part of the bigger challenge in the global south is that most of the population seem to be trapped in cultural and religious orthodoxy whereby there is an unhealthy growing culture of religious fanaticism. A strong belief in superstitions, witchcraft and magic by political and church leaders has taken a new twist: politicians promise miracles to the population and so do the fake priests and prophets. In Zambia for instance, conmen of all hues purporting to be prophets have taken advantage of the illiterate masses to swindle them of their money through the provision of 'prayers' and 'holy anointing oil'. In Tanzania, 20 people in 2019 were reported to have died at a stadium stampede as they attempted to get so-called 'holy anointing oil' from a self-styled pastor who was promising prosperity and cure of disease from unsuspecting worshippers. So, education (and by extension, scientific knowledge) is an important element for the population if these shallow and primitive practices are to cease (The Guardian Newspaper, 2 February 2020).\nAnother area that has become prominent in the cultural, religious and political discourse is that of homosexuality: while culture and religion in most conservative polities such as Africa forbid gay practices on grounds that such practices are Western, empirical evidence suggest that gay practices have always existed on the continent. The argument that homosexual practices were brought by European colonialists have failed to hold water-facts on the ground simply do not support this simplistic narrative. Oral African history of the 1800s has confirmed that homosexuality is not new in Africa and has always existed . . . what is new in Africa is homophobia which Europeans brought clothed in religious doctrines (Tendi, 2010). Attempts therefore by some (African) governments to pass legislation banning homosexuality are not tenable in the long run. Discriminatory tendencies such as legislation are not a sustainable solution to this matter-the real solution lies in societies coming to terms with the reality that gay practices (like prostitution) do exit in every polity. Scholars such as Msibi (2011) and Mwaura (2006) would argue that scientific evidence has shown that homosexuality is not a fashion show, but an orientation. In this modern age of fast-track scientific evolution, homosexuality need not be a topic that carries headlines . . . it is not an issue . . . it is like hair color . . . some people have blonde hair while others have black, brunette, or red hair. For instance, some women are so hairy that they even have beards on their chins-inclinations that are usually associated with men, while some men have soft voices that are often associated with the female gender. These differences demonstrate the diversity of the compositions of human biology. From this standpoint, it makes little sense, if at all, for any government to attempt to legislate an orientation. A preference of who someone choses to love lies outside the province of the religious dictates and government control (Zwissler, 2019). Like feminists, homosexuals also believe that they live in a culture of contempt where they are still devalued based on what they are or look like. Modern societies cannot encourage cultural practices that perpetuate forms of stereotyping and discrimination (Dunton & Palmberg, 1996).\nA turning point in this gay debate can be illustrated by the June 2019 landmark Botswana High Court decision, which decriminalized homosexuality. In this court case, cultural relativists had put up a challenge in court arguing that homosexuality was eroding cultural values of Botswana and therefore urged the court not to grant homosexuals the right to exercise their sexual orientations freely. But on passing judgement, Judge Michael Leburu said that a democratic society is one that embraces tolerance, diversity, and open mindedness. Discriminatory laws not only serve as a detriment to gay people but holds back all of society. Specifically for Africa, the lofty aspirations inscribed in the much-proclaimed African Renaissance project cannot truly be realized without the full liberation of all marginalized groups. Neela Ghoshal, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch applauded the Botswana judgement; that it sent a powerful precedent on the continent that gay laws belong in the museum or the archives, not in modern life. Culture is malleable-not static-and is a patriarchal construct that can be reconstructed (BBC News, 2019).\nAnglican Archbishop of South Africa, Desmond Tutu, a rare religious voice on gay rights argued that gays are born that way. Dunton and Palmberg (1996) points out that Tutu opined that: . . . we blame them (homosexuals) for something which has become clear that they cannot do anything about. If indeed homosexuality was a matter of choice as cultural relativists would like us to believe, then gay people must be the craziest coots around to choose a way of life that exposes them to so much hostility, discrimination, and suffering. It is akin to saying that a black person voluntarily chooses a completion and race that exposes him or her to all the hatred, suffering and disadvantages to be found in a racist society.\nAfrica has witnessed placards displayed by anti-gay lobbyists and chants from cultural and religious loyalists saying, 'God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve'. On face value, these pronouncements might appeal to larger portions of the religious constituency but on critical examination, these sentiments lack reflective reasoning. For, while most religious people do not accept homosexuality, there are also other people who do not believe in religion itself. The right to believe in religion and the right not to believe in religion are all equal rights and yet most religious people assume that everyone must be religious-this is one of the shortcomings of religion as this attitude tends to be used as a footstall of entrenching intolerance in the wider society, a trait of religious fanaticism. This gap and lack of self-awareness by the religious fraternity needs much sensitization and (scientific) education. Here, the critical role of science in shaping peoples' thought processes need not be overemphasized.\nFormer South African High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Cheryl Carolus implored African governments not to condone actions that promote any form of intolerance. In South Africa, for instance, it is government policy that the South African society needs to be characterized by diversity and cultural pluralism where marginalization of minority groups or citizens with different sexual orientation is no longer an acceptable standard. Modern society is demanding a more inclusive conception of citizenship. Dunton and Palmberg (1996) point out that Ambassador Cheryl Carolus argued further that: . . . for the same reason that we oppose racism and sexism, we oppose homophobia. Our position has been to oppose those who felt that we should go for generalities in the constitution because we have a past of such oppression (apartheid, colonialism, and imperialism) that we feel the need to list the areas where there is still oppression . . . The Botswana high court ruling has signaled the death knell of such 'no gay' policies-notions that would never be tolerated if they referred to a person's race, gender, or religion. Human dignity is harmed when minority groups are marginalized. The court ruling is a hint that the justice train is on the move in Africa. Political observers have predicted that despite current objections on gay rights, at some future time, most African governments will catch up with mainstream IR opinion on homosexual rights. When marriage equality for gays finally occurs, people will wonder what the fuss was about. The reality of the twenty-first century is that the states' capacity to regulate political identities and loyalties of its citizens is gradually being weakened by the increase of global interconnectivity particularly the areas of science, information technology, finance, economics, and transnational trade (Linklater, 2007).\nThe significance of the emphasis on the importance of human rights protection here is that in contemporary IR, the human rights discourse-like education-lends much of its efficacy from scientific and philosophical underpinnings. It is argued that human rights protection makes it possible for individuals to unlock their potential and achieve limitless success in their endeavors. From a scientific perspective therefore, individuals can only fully realize their potential in an environment that is free from abuse, exploitation, racism, discrimination, marginalization, prejudice, racial profiling, stereotyping, and poverty.\n\nConclusion\nThis study examined how science, culture, and religion influence each other in shaping societal dispositions. To achieve this, the study took a transdisciplinary approach, which disbanded the boundaries between these conventional disciplines and attempted to (re)construct their meaning in the context of real-life societal problems. On the one hand, science lends its utility from pragmatic and experimental approaches such as employing technological methodologies that may involve computational methods, data archives, artificial intelligence and empirical observation: this is how science interprets world phenomenon. On the other hand, the ontology of culture and religion spins on hermeneutics, rhetorical, and historical approaches to interpret world occurrences: the philosophy of culture and religion assumes that epistemology is incomplete if it ignores history.\nWhile this cultural and religious foundation cannot be dismissed as idle speculation, societies must be wary of the snares of blanket reliance on history as an unchanging database for evaluating societal premises and insights. Similarly, scientific novelties must also be scrutinized because some of their processes do not lend themselves to ethical designs. The overall context of this study's argument, therefore, is that due to the contingent nature of life situations, it is imperative that we pay attention to when and how the meanings of some of the key societal notions are undergoing transformation. This study has endeavored to advance a distinctive conceptual argument that draws out the wider implications that surround the three disciplines under discussion. As such, the winner takes all notion holds little currency in this study's equation-instead, the equation encourages the give and take synopsis. As Rousseau argued, the ontology of human nature is best appreciated from the prism of integration, adaptation, and cooperation rather than from competition and contestation. The implication of this proposition can be summarised using Karl Marx's philosophical inference that the less you are, the more you have.\nThe paper has shown how, from time in memorial, there have been conflicting positions and competition between science, culture, and religion in addressing various aspects of human endeavor. Although there are some compatibilities, it can be argued that there seems to be more disagreements than agreements. Due to the differing standpoints and orientations between science, culture and religion, these gaps and competing assumptions will most certainly remain permanent features of the scientific, cultural, and religious discourses.\nThese diverse viewpoints will continue to shape and moderate each one of these disciplines in ways that would otherwise not be possible if they were compatible with each other. This is a healthy development for mitigating the effects and excesses of either science or religion and culture. This way, they operate as barometers of social, cultural, political, and economic consciousness in society."

              "How is it possible to increase knowledge in theology?\n\nThis paper is devoted to the question, is it possible to increase knowledge in the field of theology like as it is possible in humanities in general. The main difficulties first of all consist in (1) confessional character of each theology, (2) in its plurality when each theology has its own concept system and original epistemological framework, (3) in the resulting incomparability of theologies. Discussing the presumably scientific character of theology, it could be useful to discern between premodern and modern understanding of the term “science”. The author argues, there do not exist insurmountable obstacles for theology to strengthen its argumentative basis, namely, theology possesses opportunity to get closer to the human sciences if it relies on empirical researches, for instance, of psychology of religion. This thesis is illustrated on two different examples from different regions and contexts: the theory of structure of religious experience by K. Girgensohn and W. Gruehn, and the theory of political aspect of religious conversion by I. Martín-Baró. The both theologies base their generalization on correct empirical research data, — like it occurs in philosophy of religion or even human sciences. The both cases demonstrate increase of knowledge: the first on from which elements does religious experience consist and how it is developing; the second on how religious conversion is tied to change of political views and social behavior of believers. Such contact of theology with empirical science of religion is in no way harmful for the both sides; it can be initiated in various traditions, which adopt the focus of broadly understood Western-born rationality."

              "The Problem of Religion in the Political Philosophy of 'Thomas Hobbes'\n\n        Since the name 'Hobbes' in one way or another, associated with political philosophy and the problem of power in particular, rarely comes to mind, he focused on 'religion' as a sensitive and crucial subject in political matters. The prevailing view is that it deals with the issue of power in the first place. However, if we look closely at his texts, we find a major component in his philosophical thought, which is; 'Religion'. Religion as an epistemological problem and as a political problem cannot be overcome without solving it in the political space. Because wars and political instability are often due to rivalries and conflict between religious sects and internal wars, Hobbes believes that the radical solution is based on a new organization of the relationship of religion to power. Rarely did researchers analyze the concept of religion, the motives of religiosity and its relationship to power and knowledge. Therefore, the research answers the following question: Are Hobbes' criticisms of religion and its call for absolute power, the ultimate goal and ultimate end of it? or the end is; Coexistence between religions and sects and political and social stability? From here, the research tries to prove: that his criticisms of the sects and religious rivalries were for that goal. The mental assumption of instability and chaos, which he calls the 'natural state', and the transition from a state of 'war of all against all' to stability can only take place through a social contract that guarantees coexistence and ensures that 'power' is delegated to a higher authority only. Absolute power is a means, not an end in itself. So, the coexistence between the different components of society under one roof is the framework that guides Hobbes' thought. Key words: Aristotle, religion, opposition to authorities, stability, politics."

              "Divine Simplicity and The Myth of Modal Collapse\n\nThis paper responds to the modal collapse argument against divine simplicity or classical theism offered by neo-classical or complex theists. The modal collapse argument claims that if God is both absolutely simple and absolutely necessary, then God’s act of creation is absolutely necessary, and therefore, the existence of the created world is also absolutely necessary. This means that God and His creation collapse into a single modal category of absolute necessity without any contingent beings. My response is grounded in the Islamic Neoplatonic philosophy of Ibn Sina and the Ismaili tradition. I offer four arguments that allow a Muslim Neoplatonist to absorb a modal collapse in a possible worlds modality while negating modal collapse within an Avicennian modality: First, the modal collapse objection is based on a possible worlds framework whose concept of necessity is overly broad; this framework fails to distinguish between God as ontologically necessary in Himself, created being as dependently necessary through another, and mere logical necessity, all of which are recognized by Ibn Sina and Islamic thinkers. Second, modal collapse arguments only demonstrate that creation is necessary through another but fails to prove that creation has ontological necessity or aseity––which only pertains to God; thus, no consequential modal collapse ensues when one’s modality recognizes creation as a “dependent necessary being” despite being modally necessary. Third, Islamic philosophers have a non- libertarian concept of God’s will and freedom that is immune to modal collapse objections. Finally, I argue that all classical and neo-classical theists must embrace a modally necessary creation because libertarian models of God’s will entail uncaused and brutely contingent effects."

              "Rational Faith and Believing Reason. Orthodoxy and the Works by Ivan Ilyin\n\nThis article considers Ivan Ilyin’s approach  to the philosophy of religion, Orthodoxy and the Church from the viewpoint of his creative biography. The addition of new materials from the notionalist’s archive, such as memoirs and letters concerning religious issues and the use of the patristic tradition  in the philosophical concept of the thinker, give this review an element  of novelty.  The novelty of the study is also strenghtened by the author’s focus on the question of how the philosopher understood the role and significance of Orthodoxy. The main milestones of the philosopher’s biography are considered from the viewpoint of his works revealing the evolution of his thought. This article highlights the reasons  for Ilyin’s separation from the representatives of the new religious consciousness. Special attention is paid to the philosopher’s connection with representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia as well as his participation in Christian circles and meetings.  The emphasis is also laid on the connection between the social and political views of the  notionalist  regarding  the  future  of Russia and Orthodoxy and its importance for the building a healthy statehood. The philosopher’s method and the role of the reason in the process of the knowledge of God are revealed on the example of the philosophy of religion. The Orthodox doctrine had asserted a significant influence on the philosopher’s thinking. Although it is widely accepted that Ivan Ilyin had not yet been a believer during the Moscow period of his creative activity, and instead  approached the worldview issues exclusively from the standpoint of the pure reason, facts can be demonstrated that  suggest the opposite. Inspired by German philosophy, Ivan Ilyin still refused to base his philosophical method on the  Hegelian approach to a man and God, and, in his search, turned instead to the legacy of the Apostolic Fathers through reflections on Socrates.  According to the notionalist, the way to renew the spiritual culture from the state of deep  crisis was to construct a correct religious experience based on humility and integrity of the knowledge."

              "Borders within Borders: Superkilen as the Site of Assimilation\n\nCultural assimilation of “Muslim” immigrants in Europe poses a foundational question to political philosophy: is assimilation a prerequisite for socio-economic integration? What is often interpreted as the symptom of failed integration is the proliferation of ethnic enclaves in European metropolises. Non-white immigrants who experience discrimination and marginalization withdraw into isolated zones, creating internal borders within cities. These spaces are susceptible to a host of social problems and often become a fertile ground for radicalization. The State turns to design techniques to break open these ghettoized zones. This paper analyzes an urban renewal project that was conceived to address marginality in one such neighborhood in Copenhagen. Despite the façade of inclusivity and democratic participation, the design creates a parody of Muslim cultures by remixing culturally-significant symbols. In representing immigrants’ cultures as “Other,” the ideology of design mirrors the exclusionary preferences of the politics of the border."

              "Is God Perfectly Good In Islam\n\nBased on a question posed by global philosophy of religion project regarding the absence of literal attribution of omnibenevolence to God in the Qur’ān, this paper aims to examine how to understand perfect goodness in Islam. I will first discuss the concept of perfect goodness and suggest that perfect goodness is not an independent attribute on its own and it is predicated on other moral attributes of God without which the concept of perfect goodness could hardly be understood. I will examine perfect goodness by a specific emphasis on the attribute of justice as one of the conditions to be satisfied by a perfectly morally good being. In so doing, I will appeal to the distinctions made among great-making properties by Daniel Hill, and Al-Ghazālī’s definition of justice by applying them to God’s moral attributes. I will argue that justice has a crucial role in maximality-optimality balance between great-making properties and it seems quite difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of goodness without justice. Having said that, I will claim that the conceptual frame I suggest sheds light on why omnibenevolence is not literally attributed to God in the Qur’ān. Then, I will briefly show how the divine attributes mentioned in the Qur’ān and the discussions about divine names and attributes in the Islamic tradition supports the understanding of perfect goodness I defend. Consequently, I will try to show that far from indicating that the Islamic concept of God doesn’t involve perfect goodness, the Qur’ān establishes the proper meaning of perfect goodness by focusing on its constitutive attributes, and thus provides us with a sound conception of it."

              "Religion and Cosmopolitan Society: Religious Conflict Settlement Based on Legal Culture\n\nConflicts occur when people believe that they are different from others and conflict in religion is no different. Religious conflicts in Poso and conflicts between Sunnis and Shiites in East Java have the effects of conflict, including protracted social friction, which prevents the development of a cohesive community. This research uses a socio-legal approach, where the study of law combines the approach of legal and social sciences. Establishing a way to settle religious conflicts is done by drawing up a legal basis for a settlement that accommodates human rights and democracy, emphasizing horizontal relations between religious communities. The existence of a legal culture becomes a meeting point for religious views, namely, prioritizing human rights. So, in the future, resolving conflicts based on legal culture in a cosmopolitan society is recommended.\n\nThe abundance of various religions and beliefs has led Indonesia to experience a lot of social friction. The stereotypical differences between religion and belief cause religious conflicts, for example, in Aceh, which applies Islamic sharia law strictly, conflicts between Muslim and Christian communities were triggered. This conflict spread to efforts to demolish the houses of worship of the Christian community in Aceh (Marshall 2018). Poso, in Central Sulawsi, is the site of a religious conflict that began in the 1990s.Originally, Poso was home to many Muslims; however, the dominance of Islam began to shift to Christianity with the influx of migrants from other places, causing social friction that triggered conflict between adherents of the two religions (Islam and Christianity). The Poso conflict has developed not only as a religious conflict but has been colored by economic, social, cultural and political motives (Aragon 2001).\nClashes between Muslim and Christian youth organizations marked the beginning of both the first and second phases of the conflict and riots that broke out in Poso. On the other hand, it is speculated that a great number of additional elements played a role at the beginning of the religious struggle that resulted in massacre, damage, and displacement of the population. Among these factors are the following: • Economic competition between the indigenous population of Poso, which is predominantly Christian, and migrants from Bugis, Buton, Makassar, and transmigrants from Java, who are predominantly Muslim; • Competition between government officials regarding positions in the bureaucracy-in terms of the division of power in the regions between Christian and Muslim elements; and • Political and economic instability following the fall of Suharto's New Order regime.\nReligious conflicts can occur between two religious groups and groups of different sects within one religion; this happens because of a lack of respect, appreciation, and tolerance in religion. An example is found in the Sampang conflict involving Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah (Sunni) and Shia Islam followers. The Sampang conflict began in 2004 and was followed by burning of a house belonging to a Shia sect (Hilmy 2015;Ida & Dyson 2015). (Sunni Muslims believe that an agreement can be reached about selecting the Prophet's successor. The fact that they adhere to the Prophet's example, known as the Sunnah, is the most vital component. The Shia school of Islam maintains that the position of caliph should be reserved exclusively for Muhammad's offspring.) The conflict resulted in the burning of 9 houses of Shia worshipers and their places of worship. The destruction was carried out by 500 residents who claimed to be members of the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah (Sunni). Based on this, it can be seen that conflicts of belief are not only experienced by different religions but also within the same religion. This further shows that the problems that arise are related to religion and the \"ego\" of individuals or groups of absolute beliefs that are also believed to trigger problems.\nIndonesia's religious and cultural diversity can be a blessing or a curse (Palmer 2005). The blessings of this diversity will be realized if the community simultaneously has a sense of belonging and equality with each other so that the different feelings that create a gap between one group and another can be eliminated. Conflicts that lead to destruction of social cohesion, damage to property and livelihoods and even death are the curse of this diversity. Those conflicts especially between religious communities, stem from differing attitudes and views that are formed from the interpretation and misinterpretation of religious beliefs and practices, in addition to low cultural tolerance and excessive emphasis on individual or group 'ego'.\nMoreover, they (followers of religion) identify themselves with their religion or belief and feel that the distinguishing factor between them and others is their religion, belief or sect and that it is important to control others, for example through practices of segregation. These different feelings lead to social segregation that may in turn lead to conflict, such as happened at the State Vocational High School 2 Padang, which forced non-Muslim students to wear the hijab. Segregation is an expression of social inequality within the city area, which is indicated by the separation of people in certain residential areas due to policies, differences in socio-economic conditions, ethnicity, and race.\nThe handling of conflicts between religious communities, especially in Indonesia, needs to be carried out with a new approach that involves realizing a feeling of togetherness and equality, which is realized through the adhesive factor that unites various perceptions held by adherents of religions, beliefs and sects. Legal culture can be an alternative in building the resolution of religious conflicts because it talks about views, attitudes, and responses to the law, which can ultimately be a factor in increasing cohesion that can reduce and resolve conflicts between religious believers. This paper offers a conflict resolution approach which is expected to be a bridge for the very diverse Indonesian people to form a true cosmopolitan society.\n\nResearch Methods\nThe approach used in this study is the socio-legal approach. Socio-legal studies are studies of law using both legal and social science approaches (Creutzfeldt, Mason, & McConnachie, 2019). Seen as an alternate method to legal studies, it looks at the doctrinal study of law and how it will function in society. Sociolegal studies, then, explore how the law will work in society (empirical) (Boulanger 2020). The sociolegal approach is used to obtain data, both from the perspective of legal science and social science, in an interdisciplinary way, so that more in-depth and meaningful analysis can be carried out on the phenomena that the researchers put forward. This is done because the approach taken by textual analysis alone is not comprehensive enough, because the law is more than the written text. As a result, support from fields of study within the social sciences is required to analyze the law, particularly in the context of efforts to develop law for the future.\nIn this study, qualitative approaches are used to analyze the data. These approaches emphasize theuse of deductive and inductive inference processes and the dynamics of the link between observed events and the application of scientific logic. Most qualitative data are presented in the form of narratives, stories, written and unwritten materials (pictures and photos), and other non-numerical formats. After conducting a qualitative analysis of the data, the next step will be to derive conclusions using deductive reasoning.\n\nRELIGIOUS CONFLICTS IN INDONESIA: THE CURRENT SITUATION\nThe dynamics of human conflict, especially those with religious nuances, can never be separated from human life (Stenschke 2016). Conflicts in human life can occur in a short or long time with various background motives, both purely religious and political, social, and economic motives (Rifa'i 2010). The motives of conflict with religious nuances in Indonesia have developed in a reasonably complex direction, as happened in the religious conflict in Poso, the Sunni and Shia conflicts in East Java, or other conflicts with religious nuances in Indonesia. Although they are said to be religious, the conflicts mentioned above have other dimensions and aspects that need to be considered (Amal 2020).\nReligious conflict in Poso is a conflict that was initially limited to conflicts between individuals, which eventually developed into conflicts at the religious level. If examined further, this conflict is motivated by cultural factors, including ethnicity as well as religion. The two elements collaborated to become a time bomb that never got the right solution. After the riots in the Poso area subsided, the National Police established an Operations Field Command and carried out several operations, one of which was Operation Sadar Maleo (2000) (Gogali 2008). In 2004 the joint forces of the Indonesian National Army and the Indonesian National Police conducted Operation Sintuwo Maroso. The finding of the joint forces was that there was friction between the two religious groups that could not be suppressed. This then led to terrorist groups such as that formed by Abu Wardah, also known as Santoso. In 2015 this first operation was followed up with Operation Camar Maleo which lasted until January 2016. Through Operation Camar Maleo, at least 24 terrorists were arrested, and 7 members of the East Indonesia Mujahideen led by Abu Wardah alias Santoso were shot dead. Santoso was eventually killed, and Basri (the leader of the East Indonesia Mujahideen after Santoso) was apprehended through the Tinombala Task Force operation in 2016.\nIn addition, religious conflicts can also develop and impact economic issues such as food and fuel shortages, as experienced by the Poso people in the conflict. The impacts of conflict, protracted social friction and inappropriate resolutions can develop conflicts into acts of terrorism, as demonstrated by the East Indonesia Mujahidin group in Poso. The Poso conflict is just one of the instances of nuanced religious conflicts in Indonesia which do not even involve groups with different religions, such as the conflict between Sunni and Shia sects in East Java.\nThe conflict between Sunni (Ahlus Sunnah Wal-Jamaah) and Shia sects in East Java is another example. The province of East Java, where most of the Muslim community adheres to the Nadlatul Ulema tradition, is one of the bases for spreading Sunni Islam. Meanwhile, in the 1980s, the Shia da'wah movement began to appear in areas known as Tapal Kuda, or the Horseshoe, a tronghold of Madurese culture, which is also located in East Java Province (Pasuruan Regency, Probolinggo Regency, Probolinggo City, Lumajang Regency, Jember Regency, Situbondo Regency, Bondowoso Regency, and Banyuwangi Regency). These areas had previously been the base of the Sunni sect. Differences in historical background and beliefs between the two sects eventually led to conflicts between sects in the Tapal Kuda area, especially areas with a solid \"nahdliyin\" base such as the island of Madura.\nThe emergence of clashes between Shia and Sunni sects in Indonesia can be identified after the issuing of a fatwa from the Indonesian Council of Ulema, which states that Shia sects in Indonesia must be watched out for because the Shia ideology values are not the dominant ideology in Indonesia, which is Sunni. Shia sects began to attract public attention after the Shia-Sunni conflict in Sampangan, Madura, East Java, in 2012. Although early signs of conflict between Shia-Sunni in Sampang were apparent since 2003, with local leader, Tajul Muluk, actively spreading Shia ideology, it was still limited.\nThe heating up of Shia-Sunni relations in Sampangan, Madura, led to the physical violence that Tajul Muluk suffered when celebrating the Prophet's Birthday in 2011. On the one hand, Tajul Muluk was considered to have violated the agreement made in 2008 regarding the cessation of the group's da'wah activities; on the other hand, Tajul Muluk felt that he disagreed with the ulema's insistence on stopping their da'wah activities. The argument used by Tajul Muluk is that da'wah activities are only aimed at the followers of the group and are aimed at strengthening their own Shia group internally.\nThe actions taken by Sunni against the Tajik Muluk group were unconstitutional and did not comply with Law no. 39 of 1999 concerning Human Rights. Article 24 of the Human Rights Law stipulates that everyone has the right to assemble, and associate for peaceful purposes. Moreover, every citizen or community group has the right to establish non-governmental organizations or other organizations to participate in the course of government and state administration in line with the demands for the protection, enforcement, and promotion of human rights by the provisions of laws and regulations.\nTensions continued to escalate until, at the end of 2011, groups acting in the name of the Sunni sect carried out attacks and arson against the Islamic boarding school belonging to the Shia Karang Gayam. Furthermore, the Sampang clerics with the local government held a closed meeting with the Tajul Muluk group, which ended with the decision that the Tajul Muluk group had to stop all activities and return to the teachings of Sunni Islam; the group was required to leave the Sampang area without compensation for the land/assets they own, and if these two conditions were not fulfilled then all followers of Shia Sampang must die.\nFrom this, it can be seen that Sunni actions against Shias not only violate the right to assemble and establish organizations but also violate the constitutional right, namely the right to life, which is regulated in Article 9 of Law 39 of 1999 concerning Human Rights which states that everyone has the right to live, sustain life and improve their standard of living. In addition, everyone has the right to be peaceful, safe, happy, physically and mentally prosperous. Further, they engaged in violence and damage to property which was clearly against the law, as well as proposing remedies that were themselves illegal.\nThe conflict continued until 2012, marked by the continued violence against Shia in Karang Gayam. In mid-2012, a group of Sunni Muslims carried out attacks, vandalism and burning of the homes of Shia followers. The impact of the attack and destruction resulted in nine houses being burned and two residents dead (Manan & Paran 2020). The Sunni-Shia conflict that occurred in Sampang finally forced the expulsion of the Shia group, known as Tajul Muluk, from Karang Gayam. The expulsion of the Shia group was driven by intimidation, hate speech and terror against the Shia group.\nThe issue of the attack on the Shia group finally became a national concern until finally the Governor of East Java asked the Police to make persuasive efforts to resolve the conflict using an understanding of the religious issues. The Governor of East Java rejected the Ulema's insistence on banning Shia preaching in East Java because the central Indonesian Ulema Council did not prohibit the existence of Shias. The efforts made by the Governor of East Java are appropriate because they carry out constitutional rights as regulated in Article 12 Paragraph 2 of Law Number 39 of 1999 concerning Human Rights, which states that the state guarantees freedom of religion, the independence of everyone to embrace his religion and belief.\nThe resolution of the Shia-Sunni conflict in Sampang by expulsion cannot be separated from the question of the legitimacy of giving Tajul Muluk a heretical status, in a declaration issued by local mainstream religious figures (Ramadhan 2022). Religious figures used the fatwa issued by the East Java Indonesian Ulema Council to deceive Shia Tajul Muluk; the claim of heretical status was also issued by the NU Sampang Branch Manager and one of the Chairpersons of the East Java Nahdlatul Ulema Regional Board. Although the statements issued by the regional administrators contradicted the statements of the central management, the legitimacy given by local mainstream religious leaders encouraged intimidation and persecution of the Tajul Muluk Shia.\nIn addition to the two conflicts outlined above, other conflicts have attracted public attention, such as the religious conflict in Aceh; the conflict between Muslims and Buddhists in Tanjung Balai as a result of protests by Buddhists of Chinese descent against the volume of mosque loudspeakers, where the protest led to the actions of the public who vandalized eleven monasteries and two Buddhist religious foundations on July 20, 2016; the cutting of the cross tombstone at the public cemetery in the Purbayan area of Kota Gede, Yogyakarta; conflicts between religious communities in Papua in the form of demands for the demolition of the Al-Aqsa Sentani Mosque Tower by the Fellowship of Churches in Jayapura Regency; and so forth.\nThe significant conflicts presented above all started from minor conflicts, namely between individuals as members of a religion, showing that conflicts between religious communities cannot only be defined as large-scale or long-term conflicts. The examples of conflict with religious nuances shown above ironically cannot be said to describe the conflict between religious communities in Indonesia. Referring to the Index of Religious Harmony in Indonesia in 2021, based on survey data, shows a high level of harmony (72.39/100), but on the other hand, intolerant acts and religious conflicts still occur in Indonesia. There are similarities in the factors that cause conflicts between religions in Indonesia, namely the tendency to blame or justify one belief against another in religion.\nThe tendency to justify these beliefs encourages an attitude of demeaning and excluding religion or other beliefs that can cause friction between the two religious communities or even conflict. In addition, religious belief will be used as a form of power to force the acceptance of religious concepts on other, often minority, people who are not of the same belief. According to Armahedi Mazhar (Garaudy 1993), people who have excessive belief in a sect or religion have the potential to demonstrate the characteristics of absolutism, exclusivism, fanaticism, extremism, and aggressiveness. These traits are manifested in intellectual arrogance, social arrogance, emotional arrogance, exaggerated and transgressive responses to physical responses.\nConflicts between religions stem from the tendency of religious people to try to justify their beliefs about the religion they believe in. Adherents of each religion or sect insist that the religion or belief they profess is the most correct and reasonable. There are still those who do not have a strong understanding of the values of their beliefs. Claims that have the potential to create or thicken the boundaries of human interaction create or widen the gap between religious communities, all of which contribute to the creation of different views on people or followers of other religions, which are sometimes followed by forms of coercion. The widespread action taken by members of the Islamic Defenders Front against the usage of Christmas elements in numerous shopping center sites in Indonesia is one illustration of the assertion made above.\nAttitudes of imposing belief on other parties can be traced from religious doctrines, which contain calls to go to the path of salvation and encourage or invite other parties to participate in that goal. There is nothing wrong with salvation and an invitation to salvation. However, if these attitudes are accompanied by the justification that their belief or religion is the most correct, then this becomes a dangerous mix and actions that trigger conflicts between religious communities will emerge, especially if these frictions are used for specific purposes.\nThe diversity of religions and beliefs in Indonesia certainly conflicts with religious nuances. In Indonesia, conflicts between religious communities are resolved through non-litigation channels that prioritize deliberation and consensus, while acts classified as criminal acts will be tried as the law applies in Indonesia. However, of course, this approach is still not practical, as shown by the protracted conflicts between religious communities in Indonesia, such as the Poso conflict seen as lasting from 1992 to 2001, but which, until now, it is continuing with the emergence of the East Indonesia Mujahideen; the Shia-Sunni conflict that lasted for nine years with the resultant expulsion of the Shia sect from their village in East Java; or minor conflicts that occurred in Aceh and several other areas in Indonesia.\nAlthough these non-litigation steps reflect the values of the Indonesian people, which prioritize deliberation and consensus, even so, there are things that must be taken into account, in establishing this approach. First, there are differences in perceptions between parties in conflict concerning the law (both their religious law and national law), especially those relating to conflict resolution; second, the conflict resolution process in its most minor parts, namely the stages of how the settlement is formulated and executed above, still does not reflect respect for human rights, especially freedom of religion, but not forgetting the other rights possessed by humans.\n\nReligion in modern human life is transformed into an individual and collective identity (Dobratz 2001).\nHowever, religion can also develop towards a cosmopolitan orientation, especially since globalization is a destructive variable in religious concepts. These developments can be carried out in a cosmopolitan society through tolerance between one another, while in the era of globalization, it can be done through meetings between countries to create a public space that will protect the cosmopolitan rights of each actor. It must be admitted that there has been a \"rigid\" relationship between religion, its laws and teachings and its adherents; this relationship tends to be patriarchal and promotes intolerance (Adeney-Risakotta 2014). For example, all women are required to wear the hijab to enter certain schools, so that the regulation applies to non-Muslims. Many women feel safer wearing the hijab, but investigations show that the hijab does not prevent women from being harassed or even raped. This is because the hijab is not the only way to prevent or prevent someone from being sexually harassed. Prevention of conflict must arise collectively with respect and respect for others (Sulaiman & Raifu 2020), going beyond the adoption of standards of dress.\nIn a cosmopolitan view, intolerance is present as a manifestation from the perspective of religious adherents who make religion their primary identity as human beings (Bennett 1986); with this view, there is a tendency to separate or secularize religion in modern development and globalization. This view assumes that the modern state must separate itself from religion, because religion is a personal matter for each person or group that cannot be regulated equally in a modern state. From this ideal view, religion is valued as a separate, distinct and unique entity from modern society, which refers to a collection of personal values and activities. In the context of modernity, it is customary to distinguish religion as a social system and faith as one's initial response to divinity. In the past, religion gave standard meaning to humans when looking at nature and life. Religion answered the problem of death, suffering, and disaster, albeit with deceptive explanation. In the last few centuries, the position of religion has been sidelined by science. What was once answered by religion is now answered by science. Religion lost its authority, first in explaining nature and finally in giving life instructions. Natural science has replaced religion in understanding the world, and psychology has replaced subjective human experience.\nConflicts with religious nuances arise due to the failure of the internalization process of religion. For example, the failure of religious education is because Islamic Religious Education concentrates more on cognitive theoretical problems and lacks attention on how to change cognitive knowledge into \"values\" that need to be internalized in students through various means, including the media, as well as forums. The discussions have always revolved around religious issues that are ritual-formal in nature and aqidah/ theology that seem exclusive. More substantial religious issues are not exposed critically, for example, piety in a social context. As a result, religious messages that are eternal are buried behind exclusive religiosity. The texts are read every day, but their true meaning is neglected. So far, our national education system is believed to be more focused on knowing the religious text, while the understanding of the meanings and the ability to apply the principles from the affective and psychomotor aspects have been neglected. This will lead to internal conflict in students; they know the texts, but their attitudes and behavior are not socially appropriate. They do not reflect the achievement of the value of Islamic Religious Education.\nCosmopolitanism describes a broad term in which aspects of moral and sociopolitical philosophy are defined in various ways but generally emphasizes the concept that all of humanity can or should even be part of one community (Dallmayr 2003;Binnie et al. 2009;Etinson 2010). This means that cosmopolitanism recognizes that all human beings must be subject to the same moral standards regardless of their identity. The boundaries that distinguish nations, countries, cultures, or socio-societies are morally irrelevant. In this case, there is no known concept of nation, religion, race, community, or culture that is dominant over other cultures However, how this community can be formed and realized is still debated, with a focus on whether secularism is endorsed or not. Being one community carries the meaning that the community is homogenous; in this context, they share a common humanity, but humans in particular and social forms are endowed with differences from birth. Social interaction and the formation of values or norms, including morals, occur through these differences; cosmopolitanism is present and offers a concept to go beyond social interactions that can be an obstacle to the unification of the community. In the case of inter-religious conflicts, the known obstacle is intolerance (Regus 2020).\nConflicts that are correctly processed to have a good resolution will give birth to a constructive consensus; it could be that conflicts between religious communities can be a bridge to a cosmopolis society. The concept of a strong identity in the perspective of cosmopolitanism is a sign that these community groups still have a long way to go to become a cosmopolitan society. A strong sense of identity is more likely to create or encourage destructive conflict (Haynes 2009), as happened in Poso and Sampang. It should be understood that although the use of the notation \"identity\" is strongly related to the individual, identity can also be used to represent the collective concept of a group, community, or state with various relationships formed in it, both ethnic, religious, and cultural entities. Identity is also often used as a marker of the value of a person or group in conflict, so it can be ascertained that there is friction or collision of values with one another, likewise in the concept of religious conflict, which can be explained as the friction of believed identities, values, and religious norms.\nWhen explored more deeply, intolerance in religion is rooted in the perspective or understanding of the law or religious teachings that tend to be rigid. The rigidity of these perspectives or views increases tension between religious communities or, in other words, tensions between individuals or groups who have different perspectives or understandings. These tensions eventually widen the gap that exists as a result of differences. This is different from cosmopolitanism, which seeks to unite humanity into one unified community called \"world society\" (McMurran 2013).\nUniting all human beings also means eliminating boundaries between individuals and groups because these boundaries are the inhibiting factors for achieving a single community, a \"world society\" (Mayall 1990). A single community is formed or established based on humanitarian principles. Imagine the individual as a circle so that a group formed from individuals consists of small circles united by \"one\" the same factor, either values, understanding or other factors. In the perspective of cosmopolitanism, the individual circle should have no shape or form but a universal circle formed by human beings in the world (Parekh 2003).\nThe resolution of religious conflicts in the eyes of cosmopolitanism is said to prioritize human rights through a democratic process. So, has the resolution of religious conflicts in Indonesia reflected the intended solution? The resolution of the conflict in Poso has gone in the intended direction, even though the results obtained do not seem to be able to reflect the priority of human rights and democracy. This is shown by the military operation that still had to be carried out after the negotiations for peace between the conflicting parties were carried out in 2001, which is a strong indication that one party was still not satisfied with the results of the negotiations. This is where democracy should play a role, as stated by Emanuel Kant who proposed that democracy is a bridge to peace. The same thing was shown in settlement of the Shia-Sunni conflict in Sampang, which ended with the expulsion of the Shia group from the area. The resolution of this conflict contradicted the protection of human rights and led to a loss of democracy. The democratic process is essential in conflict resolution that prioritizes respect for human rights, especially in diverse cultural, ethnic, and religious societies.\nAccepting the cosmopolitan concept does not mean denying the existence of diversity; although diversity can be a barrier to the achievement of a single community, this diversity can also be a source of change (Green 1999;Norris & Inglehart 2009). Diversity and conflict can be factors to move a community, form a new consensus, to build a new set of values and morals to reflect this diversity. One concept that can be used to describe diversity is the American metaphor of a salad bowl (Leslie et al. 2020). This metaphor was chosen to describe the different sets of democratic values and multicultural ideologies full of tolerance. Unlike the melting pot metaphor, the salad bowl metaphor does not see differences as barriers. This metaphor echoes equality and justice based on the law, which sees that every individual has equal rights and obligations even though they have a cultural background or, in this context, a different religion, sect, or belief. From this perspective, the differences do not exist. The necessary shared perspective is that everyone has equal rights and obligations.\nConflicts, especially in religious communities, often occur due to the increasing tension between followers (Syarif 2019). Resolving conflicts means also elaborating on the existing tensions; in the view of cosmopolitanism, unravelling these tensions begins with realizing that, in the end, we are human beings who have equal rights and obligations. Itis this that seems impossible to realize, and for this a balance between the perspectives must be achieved (Zürn & de Wilde 2016). The balance in question is a perspective that respects other perspectives about social interaction as a basis and social conflict as a continuation (Lincoln 2000).\nDifferent perspectives on religious law and teachings, leading to conflicts between religious communities, must be united by one binding agent (Wibisono, Louis, & Jetten, 2019). Differences in religions exist, it is true. This argument is not formed to reject these differences but is made to form a more flexible approach to the perspectives of other individuals or groups. The binding agent in religion referred to here is the teaching of love and compassion that prioritizes compassion, peace, and mutual respect over the calls for violence and intolerance. The important aspect is the development of the balance between tolerance and intolerance, especially through scholarship on the topic.\n\nBUILDING A LEGAL CULTURE OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION BETWEEN RELIGIOUS PEOPLE\nThrough the arguments made, it is understood that differences and rigidities in the perspectives of adherents of religions, sects and beliefs are a source of conflict between religious communities and a perspective that tends to be more flexible in disentangling the rigidity of these perspectives is needed (Davies & Thate 2017). Moreover, conflicts with religious nuances are becoming more intensive because they tend to deviate from the direction of settlement or even deviate from constructive goals and potential for socialization. Indonesia is devoting significant resources investigating these conflicts and mediating differences of opinion, even among officials, thus directing energies away from the development of a nation based on shared social values. This tendency arises because of the superposition of emotions, facts, and different perspectives. Conflict resolution with religious nuances often does not produce results because it focuses only on the goal or result rather than the process that is carried out and must be carried out. This is where a legally based conflict resolution process must be given priority.\nAs described in the examples of conflicts between religious communities in Indonesia, a single formula cannot be found to resolve the conflict. Repressive efforts are no longer relevant in conflicts with religious nuances, especially in the concept of cosmopolitanism, because in their implementation, there is often a neglect of the rights of the conflicting parties (Haynes 2020). A restorative conflict resolution approach is considered more relevant because it has an approach that prioritizes the equality of the rights of the conflicting parties, which is in line with the concept of cosmopolitanism which encourages equality of rights (Woodhouse & Ramsbotham 2005).\nConflict resolution between religious communities through a restorative justice approach emphasizes conflict resolution efforts by forming a collective agreement with a neutral mediator who does not make decisions or conclusions for the parties but supports the facilitator for the implementation of interparty dialogue with an atmosphere of openness, honesty, and exchange of opinions. In other words, the problem-solving negotiation process is a process in which impartial and neutral outside parties work with the disputing parties to help them reach a consensus that prioritizes the equal rights of the parties to the conflict. Conflict resolution is by the principles of restorative justice, where restoration or repair is an alternative way to bridge the perpetrators of the violations, victims and the community (Sukardi 2014).\nResolving conflicts between religious believers can be achieved by building awareness of a sense of brotherhood towards various cultures, religious teachings, and existing sects. By prioritizing this, we can minimize the tension that exists between religious communities (Harpviken & Røislien 2005). This goes beyond accepting that the law should treat all faiths equally, to a deeper social understanding. However, it is fundamental that processes for resolving conflicts between religious communities need to have a solid juridical basis.\nLegal culture is the key to resolving conflicts between religious communities; according to Friedman (1975). For him, legal culture is related to prioritizing individual rights, which in this case can focus on human rights. If resolved properly by prioritizing human rights through a democratic process, religious conflicts can become a vital bridge in the realization of a cosmopolitan society. For this reason, a new approach to conflict resolution is needed, especially one that can increase horizontal bonds in society. For Black (1976), legal culture is a symbolic aspect of people's social life, including accommodating definitions of what is good and evil and what is right and wrong, in a similar way to the way that religion regulates what is right and good or wrong. These two opinions can be the basis for developing religious conflict resolution, namely that legal culture can be a meeting point for various perspectives and values held by the community. Against which law? Namely, on the law that regulates conflict resolution that prioritizes human rights and regulates a democratic settlement, the law does not depart from localization values or norms but, in a modern nuance, prioritizes human and democratic rights.\nLegal culture refers to perspectives, attitudes, to behavior toward legal instruments or rules, which in this case are not only limited to religious laws and teachings but are presented in a world that is easier to imagine by the public that encourages rational thinking and commitment to realizing equality and justicedesired society. The legal culture here is not limited to what develops in the general public but also to law enforcers; in Friedman's theory, what is meant is external and internal legal culture is meant because it is understood that law enforcement in the context of conflict resolution between religious communities is one of the critical agents in unravelling the conflict.\nDeveloping a legal culture that embraces restorative justice according to this argument is a priority because it is directly related to the perspective that is considered the starting point for the emergence of conflicts between religious communities. The convergence of religious views can be brought together through such a legal culture. It was reaffirmed that a restorative justice approach is flexible, that is, flexible in dealing with different perspectives in religion. This perspective is one that can suppress irrationality, exclusivity, intolerance, discrimination, and focus on the understanding that all human beings have equal rights. The legal culture in question would be able to soften the arrogance of adherents of all religions who start from the point where respect for human rights becomes a shared priority. Such a legal culture would become the meeting point of commitment for all elements of religious communities.\n\nConclusion\nOne thing that leads to conflict is when people of one religion make assumptions about people of other religions. All over the world, people of different religions have tried to attack each other, kill each other, and burn each other's houses of worship and other important places. In the last few decades, many people of other religions have said that Muslims are radical, intolerant, terrorists, fundamentalists, and have a very biased view of the truth of other religions. Equally, Christians are often seen as aggressive, ambitious and powerful in a community. Religious conflicts in Poso, in Aceh and in East Java have shown the damaging effects of conflict on local communities. Everyone can or should even be part of one community in a cosmopolitan society. This sense of being one community contains within it the understanding there will inevitably be differences in social forms and interactions.\nTo overcome the potential for escalating conflicts, and establish a basis for settlement of religious conflicts, a restorative justice approach is proposed. In setting up this approach, human rights must be prioritized in a legal culture that has a solid juridical basis. This means that anyone who escalates a conflict, even if they do not use religious symbols, must be punished firmly and fairly within the law. As a first step, law enforcement, in this case, the Police, must respond right away to all religious conflicts by investigating each one quickly, firmly, impartially, and thoroughly; this is essential, so that the problems do not spread and become more complex. Second, the people involved should be able to protect themselves, but at the same time not exacerbate the problem. Indonesia was built on the idea of Bhineka Tunggal Ika, which says that a country should be made up of people from different races, religions, and ethnic groups. The process of restorative justice should reinforce the idea that, under this principle, as citizens, it is our responsibility to look out for each other, control ourselves, and learn to respect and tolerate those different from us. Third, the Draft Law on Religious Harmony needs to be ratified quickly to be used as a legal framework for regulating relations between very different religious communities and resolving religious conflicts from a legal perspective.\nThere is scope to be optimistic that in the future, there will not only be a society where everyone has the right to follow their religion and worship as they see fit but also a society where everyone respects each other and has a high level of tolerance so that Indonesia can remain united and whole. Religious harmony is made up of relationships between different religions based on tolerance, mutual understanding, and respect for equality in how they follow their religious teachings and work together for the good of society, nation, and state. A legal culture, including processes of restorative justice, to support this ideal will be essential."

              "Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas' Concept of Islamizing Science and its Relevance to Islamic Education\n\nIslamization of science Islamic education Naquib al-Attas Curriculum Islamic education has become less moral due to the religious and general science separation. This split in science is blamed on the West's secularization. Adding religious and general science to the Islamic education curriculum can solve this problem. This study aims to determine what Syed Muhammad Naquib Al Attas meant by Islamizing science and how it relates to Islamic education. This article uses qualitative descriptive research that blends history and philosophy. This study used Syed Muhammad Naquib Al Attas's books, other documents, books, and articles. According to Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas, the idea of Islamizing science is to free people from magical, mythological, animistic, cultural-national traditions that go against Islam, as well as from the chains of a secular understanding of thought and language and the control of their physical impulses that are often secular and unfair to their nature or soul. Islamic education develops the body, spirit, and mind (Insan Kamil). This research contributes to Islamic education by strengthening the epistemology of the Islamization of science and its relation to Islamic education.\n\nScience should be developed in order to be piety and worship Allah almighty. This is important to emphasize because the encouragement of the al-Quran to study natural and social phenomena must be balanced with the command to serve Allah Almighty in a broad sense, including developing science. From the Islamic perspective, there is no separation between science and the religion of Islam. Moreover, science and technology are tools used by humanity to carry out the duties of their caliphate. The holy book of the Qur'an contains many verses that provide information about natural phenomena and encourage humanity to make observations or observations about these phenomena. Similarly, the Sunnah of the Apostle has encouraged Muslims to seek knowledge (Sholichah, 2018).\nAccording to Al Attas, the biggest challenge facing Muslims today is a science that has lost its purpose. According to al-Attas, today's science is the product of confusion and skepticism that puts doubt and speculation on par with scientific methodology and makes it an excellent epistemological tool in the search for truth (Muttaqien, 2019). As adherents of the majority of religious believers in Indonesia, Muslims have not paid attention to the originality and quality of their knowledge and education. That disrespect has left Muslims trapped in a modern system of science and education that tends to be secular. As a result, the higher the knowledge and education obtained, the farther Muslims are from religious teachings. This progress they have achieved is a quasi-progress. On the one hand, Muslims have become acquainted with modern western civilization, but on the other hand, they have lost a firm foothold, that is, the guidelines of life derived from the Qur'an and as-Sunnah. Seeing this phenomenon, al-Attas considered that Muslims seemed at a crossroads, so it was not easy to choose the right direction. Therefore, Muslims finally seems to take an ambiguous stance between the Islamic tradition and the values of modern western civilization. This view of dualism is the cause of the decline experienced by Muslims. It has even reached a severe and alarming level that he calls \"malaisme\" (Dewi et al., 2020).\nRelated to the Islamic education system, it is not appropriate to separate general knowledge from religion. In order to give birth to a generation of intelligent people with a charitable character, the dualism or dichotomous curriculum must be abolished. This dualism in Islamic education is a paradoxical condition that occurs in the implementation of education which ends in separating the subject of study referred to as Islamic and un-Islamic to scientific disciplines in education. So on a pragmatic scale, Islamic schools tend not to give a large room to studies that they label \"general sciences.\" The existence of a dichotomy of education and the secularization of science which is contrary to the principles of Islamic education, ultimately causes the goals of Islamic education not to be achieved. At the same time, the purpose of Islamic education is to form a Muslim person, to form a human being with noble character, and to form a human being as a good servant of Allah. In the holy books of the Qur'an and Hadith, there is great concern about the purpose of Islamic education with its various aspects. This goal can be discussed in the study of intentions (Muliati & Rezi, 2017). Many terms have almost the same meaning as intention.\nThe intention is linguistically derived from the root word nawā, which means, among others: al-'azmu, meaning a solid heart desire (Sobry, 2013). In terms of the word intention, which al-Suyuthi interprets, it is an effort to grow the heart in line with what he sees to benefit life in this world and the hereafter. The intention desired by syara' (religion) is a desire directed to work to gain the pleasure of Allah SWT and take the wisdom in it. From the description above, it can be said that the goal is a manifestation of the intention, so the formulation of goals in Islamic education is as important as the intention to organize Islamic education and is as essential as Islamic education itself.\nTo overcome the problem of this dichotomy, scientists in the 20th century proposed an idea to restore the nature of the purpose of Islamic education so that the problem of the dichotomy of science would no longer exist. The idea or ideas are an attempt to Islamize science which is a critical response to western civilization that is secular, dry of the values of spirituality, dichotomous of reason-revelation, which results in the emergence of humanitarian problems such as moral degradation, emptiness of the soul, and taqlid tradition among Muslims (Musyrifin, 2016).\nThe Islamization of science becomes very important to formulate because the biggest problem in Indonesia's world of Islamic education is not ignorance but the knowledge that is understood and spread by the Western civilization that is not by Islamic values. This is because the dichotomy of science and religion can be seen in two types of education, namely the existence of an education system that still reflects a dichotomy that separates religious knowledge from general science (ZA, 2014). In most of our society today, there is still an assumption that \"religion\" and \"science\" are different entities and cannot be found. Both are considered to have their territory regarding formal-material objects, research methods, and criteria for truth. The role played by scientists, their respective theories' status, and even their institutions' implementation.\nVarious issues of Islamization of science are inseparable from the pros and cons of Muslim and Western scientists (Siregar & Siregar, 2018). Those who are contras say science is science.\nIt is value-free. Moreover, vice versa for those who agree that science is closely related to religious values because the essence of science comes from the God who created the universe.\nThus, it becomes a necessity that studies science as a means to increase our devotion to God Almighty.\nA figure who tried to reunite science and religion, including Syed Muhammad Naquib Al Attas, with the concept of Islamization of his science. Syed Muhammad Naquib Al-Attas vigorously criticized the ideas of previous Muslim figures who were stuck on the concept of secularization. Naquib Alatas's opinion in his book entitled Islam and Secularism explain the meaning of Islamization of science as: \" The liberation of man from magical, mythological, animistic traditions, national culture (which is contrary to Islam) and from the shackles of secular understanding of his thinking and language, as well as liberation from the control of his physical impulses that tend to be secular and unfair to the nature of himself or soul because the man in his physical form tends to forget his nature the truth.\" Islamization is a process toward its original form (Fithroh), which is not as strong as the process of evolution and devolution (Muttaqien, 2019).\nAccording to Al Attas, the Islamization of science in the process involves two main interconnected steps: first, the process of removing essential Western elements and concepts from science. Second, incorporate the principal elements and concepts of Islam into it.\nAccording to al-Attas, to Islamize science, several things must be done, namely: first, a person who understands science needs to meet the pre-conditions. That is, he must be able to identify the Islamic view of life while understanding Western culture and civilization. Secondly, the Islamization of contemporary science involves two processes: a) isolating the elements and fundamental concepts that make up western culture and civilization of any field of modern science today, specifically in the humanities. b) Include Islamic elements and key concepts in each relevant field of current science.\nWith the idea of Islamization of science, Muslim scientists try to unravel the moral degradation problem in Indonesia. Departing from the background of the above problems, researchers are interested in compiling research in the form of a thesis entitled \"The Concept of Islamization of Science According to Syed Muhammad Naquib Al Attas and its Relevance with the Objectives of Islamic Education.\"\n\nMethod\nThis study uses library research, a data collection technique that studies books, literature, notes, and reports on educational thought in Islamic and Western views. This research uses relevant journals, materials, and information to be collected, read, and studied, recorded as a guide or reference source. The method of library research or library research in this study can be used as a source of data and data on the topic of the problem (Saihu, 2020). Research with this type of library research method uses library sources, namely primary sources and secondary sources.\nThe main source of this research refers to the thought of the Islamization of Al-Attas in the book Islam and Secularism. At the same time, secondary sources are taken from previous scientific works, books, papers, articles, journals, encyclopedias, magazines, or websites related to the Islamization of education. Data collection in this study was carried out by examining the Islamization of education in the view of Islam according to Al-Attas in the book Islam and Secularism by Syed M. Naquib al-Attas. This data analysis is descriptive-analytic. The fragmentation or description of the collected data that has previously been studied from primary and secondary sources from the book Philosophy and Practice of Islamic Education by Syed M. Naquib Al-Attas by Wan Mohd. Nor Wan David will then analyze the data and then make efforts to implement it.\n\nResults and Discussion\nIslam is identified with dîn, which is generally interpreted as a religion that must be understood and interpreted. If referring to it in English is referred to as a religion, then what is meant and understood about the religion is dîn, where all the basic meanings contained in the word dîn are understood and form a unity of meanings that are integrated, as depicted in the Quran and derived from Arabic. In the later explanation, the primary meanings of the word dîn can be summed up into four: (1) the state of debt; (2) surrender; (3) judicial power; (4) natural tendencies. These meanings are placed in the appropriate context, where they carry the meaning of beliefs, behaviors, and teachings that a Muslim follows individually or collectively as one person incarnate as a whole as a religion called Islam (Muttaqien, 2019).\nJudging from the explanation above, the meaning of Islam, according to Naquib covers all aspects and times for the life, problems, and ultimate goals of every Muslim, both individually and as a whole. The state of debt implies that every Muslim has obligations that must be carried out. So is the surrender that is the goal of a Muslim's real life to obey and become a faithful servant to Allah. The concepts of law, regulation and justice, and authority, as well as the improvement of social culture contained in the meaning of judicial power, are a mirror that every Muslim must obey and obey the legal order outlined in the shari'a through the Qur'an and al-Hadith. At the same time, natural tendencies mean that customs, customs, carrying, or other natural tendencies are also incorporated into the concept of Islam.\nFrom a different aspect, Naquib makes another comment that Islam is a delver of the Divine cosmos system. The Islamic man who realizes his destiny means that he is a physical being. Also, a deliver than the cosmos, or is a microcosmic picture, 'alam shaghir, from the Eka Puspitasari & Anaas Tri Ridlo Dina Yuliana (Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas' Concept …) macrocosm, 'alam al-Kabir (Ghoni, 2017). This view is used in providing an understanding of Islam through human dependence on the Creator. So man has a relationship with the Creator through the order of worship and aspects of knowledge that explain the essence of Islam. In the same book, al-Attas also says that Islam is a subjective personal religion for individuals as well as an objective religion that encompasses society and that this religion applies within the individual as a single entity as well as in a society composed of single entities as well as in a society composed of those entities collectively (Damyati, 2015). This difference gives a deep meaning that the level of Islam is stratified by self-actualization in carrying out Islamic teachings.\nAccording to him, Islamic teachings cover all spheres of life. All virtues are religious deeds.\nThis virtue must relate to freedom from the rational soul, which means the ability to do justice to oneself (Damyati, 2015). So with Islam, every Muslim is declared to be benevolent if he tries to use his mind to develop freedom of thought. From this freedom of thought, Naquib opens his mind about the Islamization of science, or in a cursory conclusion, it is called Islamizing the sciences. If you look back before entering into the Islamization of science from Naquib, this step Naquib said that the biggest challenge faced by Muslims is the challenge of knowledge being spread throughout the Islamic world by Western civilization. According to Al-Faruqi, the Islamic education system has been printed in a Western caricature, where Western science has been detached from human values and dignity and spiritual values and dignity with God. For Al-Faruqi, the approach used was to re-pour the entire treasure of Western science within the framework of Islam, namely the rewriting of tech books and various disciplines with insight into Islamic teachings. In the agreed view, according to Al-Attas, the first way is that western science must first be cleared of elements that are contrary to the teachings of Islam, then formulate and combine the essential elements of Islam and key concepts to produce a composition that summarizes the core knowledge.\nIslamization of science means Islamizing or purifying the science of Western products that have been developed and used as a reference in the discourse on the development of the Islamic education system to obtain science with an \"Islamic style .\"According to Faisal, Islamic science must include human faith, goodness, and justice as individuals and society (Sassi, 2018). Through the Islamization movement, this science has the aim of advancing Islamic civilization, which is currently slumped by the advancement of science and technology, and also does not want a deterioration in the condition of the people, and also the Islamization of P-ISSN: 2337-5264 | E-ISSN: 2656-0984 Vol. 10, No. 2, October 2022  this science can align or combine religious science and also modern science in the educational process.\nThere are at least five concepts that started the idea of the Islamization of science, according to Naquib, First, The Idea of Man. According to al-Attas, man is a creature consisting of two elements: body and spirit. Therefore, it cannot be said to be a pure spirit creature and a pure corpse, but a creature of fusion of these two elements. Nevertheless, in al-Attas's view, the man's identity is strongly determined by his spirit. Therefore, the human spirit will not die and is always aware of itself. It has several designations that depend on its inclinations, namely ruh (rūh), soul (nafs), heart (qalb), and intellect ('aql) (Arroisi & Sari, 2020). Second, Ideas on the Definition and Meaning of Education. According to al-Attas, education is the recognition and recognition that is gradually instilled in man the exact things of all things in the order of creation in such a way that it guides towards the recognition and recognition of God in the order of form and personality (Siregar & Siregar, 2018).\nThird, Ideas about educational goals. Naquib argued that the purpose of Islamic education was to instill virtue in \"man\" as an individual and as part of society. Ideally, Naquib wanted Islamic education to produce a universally good human being (al-insān al-kāmil) see fig 1. In this case, the suitable human being in question is an individual who is civilized, wise, recognizing, and aware of the reality of something, including God's position in that reality. A goal leads to two dimensions: as 'Abdullah (servant of Allah) and as Khalîfah fil-Ardh (God's representative on earth). With high hopes, Naquib wanted Islamic education to produce a complete human being, insān kāmil, which is universally characterized by insight and science by reflecting on the example of the prophet Muhammad SAW. The religion of Islam, through its holy book, namely the Quran, provides an ideal example of a civilized person, namely the Prophet Muhammad Saw. Therefore, Islamic education must reflect the perfect human being.\nMeanwhile, the purpose of education in the concept of ta'dib is to produce good human beings.\nThe most fundamental element in Islamic education is the cultivation of ethics because ethics, in its sense, includes the spiritual and material life of the man that gives the good qualities he seeks (Wiratama, 2011).\nFour, The idea of the Islamic Education System. Naquib's idea of the Islamic education system cannot be separated (separately) from his meaning of the concept of education. The Islamic education system for Naquib must contain elements of ethics and science because the essence of education is the formation of a noble human disposition and morals capable of developing science that is beneficial to himself in particular and to humanity in general. The education system he formulated was to integrate science into the Islamic education system, meaning that Islam must present and teach in its educational process not only religious sciences but also rational, intellect, and philosophical sciences. However, science and technology must first be based on religious values and teachings considerations. Because macro-wise, it can be concluded that western conceptions of education still colonize Islamic education. Science is still viewed dichotomously, so no integration of science should be realized to develop science that is insightful and has Islamic nuances.\n\nFig 1. The Purpose of Islamic Education\nFifth, Ideas about science. Science is a sub-system that cannot be separated from Islamic education. Where Naquib states: education is an attempt to instill something gradually into the man (Novayani, 2017). Naquib defines science from an epistemological point of view as the pervasiveness of the meaning of something to the soul and the perversion of the soul to the meaning of something. The meaning of something here is its true meaning. The correct meaning in this context is determined by the Islamic view of the nature of the material as projected by the conceptual system of the Quran. Naquib classifies science into two parts: (1) fardu'ain is a gift of Allah that includes in it the sciences of religion (al-Qur'an, as-Sunnah, al-Sharia, theology, Islamic metaphysics or Sufism and linguistics).\n(2) fardu kifayah, which are the sciences of human achievement which include rational, intellectual, and philosophical sciences (humanitarian, natural, applied, technological sciences) (Muttaqien, 2019). From the four conceptions of Naquib's thought above we can conclude and also show that Muslims are now in contemporary times, where these Muslims must have a plurality consciousness of a situation.\nOn the basis that there is an independent attitude with the reality that occurs, and local as well as global circumstances, because from there comes what is called the Islamization of Science, which summarizes the models of catching up, redefinition, reinterpretation, revaluation, functionalization, and Islamic-scientist. Then, the model must contain nash, reason, reality, interdependence, and dynamics. This is done to achieve a life in line with the development of science, including science relevant to the development of the times that exist in this contemporary era. Syed al-Attas states that the greatest tyranny that quietly arises in our time is the challenge of knowledge. It is not a challenge of stupidity but the knowledge that Western civilization understands and spreads throughout the world.\nWestern knowledge has become problematic because it has lost its true purpose due to unjust understanding. It has also caused chaos in human life and the opening of peace and justice (Muttaqien, 2019). Furthermore, Syed al-Attas explains that Western knowledge elevates doubts and estimations to the degree of \"scientific\" methodology. That is, indecision is used as a reasonably good and unique means of epistemology to gain knowledge (Ulum, 2020). He added that Western science is not built on the foundation of revelation and religious belief. However, it is built on cultural traditions reinforced by philosophical speculations associated with secular life that make human beings rational beings.\nWestern civilization also takes the rational and scientific spirit of Islam, but this knowledge and rational spirit, when in the West, is formed or re-patterned with the culture that exists in the Western world. These fusions eventually gave birth to a dualistic character in the worldview and the values of Western culture and civilization. That is, Western knowledge is not neutral but has been conquered and polluted by dualistic Western dispositions and civilizations. Consequently, further than the dualistic worldview, the Western concept of truth was not formulated on revealed knowledge or religious beliefs but above cultural traditions reinforced by the foundations of philosophical opinions and musings related to the humancentered earthly life as a physical and rational being.\nEpistemologically, Islamization has to do with the liberation of human reason from doubts (syakk), prejudices (zhann), and empty argumentation towards the attainment of beliefs (yaqîn) and truth (haq) regarding spiritual, reasoning, and material realities. This liberation process initially depended on science, but in the end, it was always built on a unique science (ma'rifah). This form of science involves the science of fardhu 'ain and fardhu kifayah.\nEspecially in contemporary science, Islamization means the liberation of science from interpretations based on secular ideologies, meanings, and expressions. In the following, the author will explain how the pattern of Islamization presumably is the intention of Syed al-Attas by explaining some of the keywords for the Islamization of science, and this is the primary keyword of Islamization of science initiated by Syed al-Attas. Some keywords of Islamization of science.\nFirst, Understanding Worldview Islam. In this case, the author must explain the meaning of the Islamic worldview because this is the forerunner that will later become the basis for the Previously, psychological theory recognized that the human psyche is material and will give birth to a denial of the final day. So with the concept of the immaterial soul, the human soul can continue its life journey after death to return to its origin, which is none other than Allah SWT. After the Islamic concept of psychology was formulated, the next task was to follow al-Attas to include the key concepts of Islam, for example, the concept of a university (kulliyahjami'ah) that is to be transformed into students studying at the University. Al-attas rejects the view that the Islamization of science can be achieved by placing an Islamic stamp on science.\nSuch an effort will only make things worse and be useless because foreign elements or germs of the disease are still present in the body of science. He Will only produce knowledge that Islam is not and secular is not (Antoni, 2017).\nThird, Characteristics of the Islamization of Naquib al-Attas. For Sayyidi Naquib al-Attas, the destruction of Islamic education due to the absence of ethics is the main foundation of Islamic education which produces many problems which, in turn, have implications for the very complex problems we face today. According to him: Confusion and misperceptions about science further create The absence of civility in society. The result of these two things is the emergence of leaders who are not only unfit to lead the people but also do not have noble character and adequate intellectual and spiritual capacities, which are indispensable in Islamic leadership. They will maintain the conditions mentioned in the first point. They will continue to control the community's social problems through the hands of other leaders who have the same character as them and dominate various sectors of life (Kosim et al., 2020). Therefore, at the individual level, the process of Islamization is directly related to the reintroduction of ethics. Since the time of the Prophet, ethics has been an essential part of Islamic education. This can be seen from the command to imitate the sunnah of the Prophet, which is conceptually one with knowledge and charity. Therefore, Islamization at the individual level emphasizes some of the degrees of the Prophet so that in order to achieve perfection, one must try to follow him. At the epistemological level, Islamization is concerned with the liberation of the human mind from doubt (syakk), prejudice (dhann), and empty argument (mira') towards the attainment of belief (yaqin) and truth (haqq) regarding spiritual reasoning and material realities. He will rid himself of all negative knowledge and false knowledge. On the other hand, he will be filled with sciences that are built on belief, namely: \"a situation where something he knows reveals itself without leaving any room for doubt or the possibility of error and illusion, and his heart will not allow such a possibility to occur.\nTherefore, the knowledge that is built on belief is positive, and therefore the outlook on life of a person who has it is also positive.\nAt the linguistic level, Islamization means cleaning and rehabilitating keywords important for discussing science from the remnants of the existing secularization effects. Islamization will return the semantic form of these keywords to their original form so that the understanding obtained from them will follow the view of life and the historical and cultural experiences in which the words were formed if the words are formed. If the language has been Islamized, then one's thoughts will be easily Islamized because language and the existence of these keywords and terminology regulate one's thinking power.\n\nal-Tarbiyah al-Jismiyah\nFrom the Islamic perspective, science is a privilege that makes humans superior to other beings. The Qur'an and hadith are sources of knowledge in the broadest sense because human reason is not perfect, and sometimes, reason cannot explain things at a basic level (Sobry, 2013). Western concept of a world that focuses only on the empirical world, but more than that, interprets reality and truth based on the metaphysical and non-empirical world. Thus the Worldview of Islam is derived from revelation supported by reason and intuition. The substance of faith and practice of worship, doctrine, and the theological system has existed in revelation and is explained by the Prophet Muhammad SAW.\nScience is based on one's accliyah efforts derived from life experience, research, and the study of physical senses of objects of material nature. Thus, the position of science and reason in the Islamization of science al-Attas is relevant to the concept of science from the Islamic perspective. Revelation is the source of science, and reason has limitations in knowing the truth in nature. Therefore, a Muslim must develop his intellect by continuing to conduct research and natural exploration to come to closeness to Allah SWT.\nIslamic education directs man to become 'Abd Allah and khalifa Allah, as Allah's representative on earth and leader over other human beings (Subaidi, 2016). In order to fulfill this nature, man must develop his essential aspects so that his duty as 'Abd Allah and khalifa or Allah can be carried out. The Islamization of al-Attas science can be said to be a solution to neutralize the people from the attitude of malaise and optimize the duties of man in the world, namely as a servant and caliph on earth. Al-Attas encouraged Muslims to play the role Allah had destined him to play: a responsible world leader. With the Islamization of science, Al-Attas wanted the formation of a superior chosen man. As found in sura al-Baqarat verse 143, which means: \"And so (also) We have made you (Muslims), a just people and a choice so that you become witnesses to (the deeds of) men and that the Apostle (Muhammad) be a witness to your (deeds).\nIn Islamic treasures, a person has many characteristics and qualifications to become a leader. These qualifications, among others, must be a Muslim with mental privileges, physical abilities, and spiritual degrees (Hidayat et al., 2020). Some scholars also gave descriptions of the requirements of Islamic leaders, such as Imam al Mawardi in his book \"al-Ahkam al-Shulthaniyat,\" mentioning that a leader must be fair, able to have faith, be healthy in soul and body, prioritize the benefit of the people, be brave and fight to fight opponents, and come from the descendants of Quraysh. Regarding this last condition, the scholars differed in opinion. Ibn Khaldun argued that a leader must be knowledgeable, just, well-off, and healthy in soul and body, influencing thinking and doing (Khalwani, 2019).\n\nal-Tarbiyah al-'Aqliyah\nMan, created by God, is equipped with a sense that distinguishes him from animals. Even his position becomes more special than an angel because of this reason. The education of reason (al-Tarbiyatul al-'Aqliyah) aims to develop the intelligence in the human brain to understand and analyze the phenomena of God's creation in the universe. Nature and its contents are like a giant sphere that is used as an object of observation and reflection so that from it, we can obtain science and technology, making it easier for us to live in the world. The principle of tawhid in the Islamization of al-Attas science deals with the liberation of human reason from doubt (syakk), prejudice (Dzann), and empty argumentation (mira') towards the attainment of beliefs (Yaqin) and truth (Haqq) regarding spiritual, reasoning, and material realities. He will rid himself of all negative sciences as well as false sciences. He should be filled with sciences built on beliefs (Muttaqien, 2019).\nSyed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas said that the universe is an integral whole because it is God's creation. God has arranged nature so that we can live in, take lessons, and be a benchmark in doing. God created the universe and wanted it to submit to the man. Humans can conduct research, analysis, and exploration of nature so that it can increase the potential of their reason. The submission of nature to humans causes humans to be able to do anything according to their will, fill nature with beauty, or even do damage. So, it can be concluded that Islamic education and the principle of Islamization of science al-Attas both say that nature, as a creation of God, is the object of reason to explore science. Islamic education aims to develop this human reason so that it can fill the universe with beauty.\nIntellectual education in Islamic education seeks to optimize the ability of human reason as a gift Allah SWT gave to take lessons from the Qur'an. The Qur'an is the primary source of knowledge, in which there are fundamental principles from various branches of science. Al-Qur'an is a revelation delivered directly by Allah SWT so that the truth is confirmed. In the principle of Islamization of knowledge, al-Attas argues that Islam, God, and revelation are one unity of truth. Because, after all, the reason is used. Ideally, there are still illusions, deviations, and uncertainties, so reason needs the support of excellent sources of revelation. Therefore, reason and revelation cannot be contradicted.\nThe operation of reason can only obtain the truth of science in revelation, and reason cannot work correctly without revelation. Reason and revelation go hand in hand and do not overlap. God knows the truth, so what He says in revelation is the truth. What is in revelation is no different from reality, so there is no possibility of a discrepancy or discrepancy between the results of thought and the facts of revelation. If there is a conflict between the product of reason and revelation, people are warned to reconsider their understanding of revelation or to review their scientific findings. The search for the truth of science by using reason continuously is a characteristic of Islamic thought. From the description above, there is a compatibility between the thought of reason education in Islamic education and the Islamization of science which states that there is no difference or separation between reason and revelation.\nIt can also be known that according to al-Attas, science comes from God, which is then interpreted by the forces of the human reason so that the knowledge possessed is an interpretation of knowledge that comes from God. With this concept, from the side of the source, knowledge is the entry of the meaning of something from God into the human soul. On the contrary, from the side of the human subject, knowledge is until the soul arrives at the meaning of something, the object of knowledge. All sciences, religious sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, philosophy, and Sufism, come from Allah because they fully understand the verses of Allah Swt (Muttaqien, 2019).\nIslamic education leads people to think about universe events using reason to believe in Allah. According to al-Attas, the Islamic faith is an absolute truth that is logical, reasonable, and explainable by thought. It is not like the Christian faith accepts everything as truth, even something irrational. The reasonable nature of the truth of the Islamic faith is evidenced by an appeal to its adherents to study the truth with reason. The Islamic faith is not believed as it is by command. However, it must be studied and researched using a logical mind because faith is not only about ethics but is included in the cognitive category because faith is related to knowledge. Education must direct the development of human reason toward faith in God. The existence of reason should make a person closer to his God rather than shunning him because everything about God is a rational truth.\n\nal-Tarbiyah al-Khuluqiyah\nMoral education is an education to improve human personality according to the morals of the Qur'an as a manifestation of religious behavior based on tawhid. Tawhid in Islam is the foundation for a person's outlook on life and life with the primary function of his creation where he carries two missions at once, namely, as a servant of Allah and as a caliph on earth.\nTherefore, Islamic education should be able to reflect the knowledge and behavior of the Prophet Muhammad SAW and be obliged to realize Muslims who can display the exemplary qualities contained in the Prophet as much as possible by their respective potentials and skills.\nThis is the point desired by al-Attas: Islamic education can realize a complete human being characterized as a universal human being in insight and scientific authority (Kosim et al., 2020). Moral education can also be called spiritual education because what is educated is the spiritual aspect of man.\nThe principle of Islamization of science initiated by al-Attas also discusses the spiritual aspect. This principle asserts that the first principle of the Islamic religion and everything Islamic is the oneness of Allah SWT. Everything we do in the world must be based on belief in Him. As previously explained, man created has the duty of serving God ('abd Allah). In all creation, God has a ukhrawi purpose: return to Him. Based on this concept, al-Attas then described the ultimate goal of education in Islam: producing \"good human beings.\" The word \"good\" in the connotation proposed by al-Attas is \"proper as a civilized man\"; that is, it encompasses man's material and spiritual life. According to al-Attas, Adab is the discipline of the body, soul, and spirit. A discipline that affirms the recognition and recognition of the proper place about the recognition of the fact that science and form are arranged hierarchically according to their level/maratib and degree/darajah (Ulum, 2020).\n\nIslamization of Science al-Attas Islamic Education Goals\nTo develop physically healthy al-Tarbiyah al-Jismiyah To develop spiritually healthy al-Tarbiyah al-Khuluqiyaah To develop reason healthy al-Tarbiyah al-'Aqliyah Spiritual objectives in Islamic education also concern morals or behavior and ethics the values of moral education as a benchmark for a person's behavior related to conscience. Moral education will form a better person. In the principle of Islamization, it is explained that (axiological) values pay great attention to one's good behavior and bad behavior, right and wrong attitudes, as well as one's way of achieving one's goals. Whether he will use good ways or wrong ways, this moral is based on God based on His revelation. Thus, the Islamization of science aims to form a complete human being and a human being who has moral values about the relationship between fellow humans and other beings created by God. Thus, the formation of human beings who are anchored in the Islamization of al-Attas science is relevant to the purpose of spiritual education (moral education) in Islamic education.\nThe three aspects of education above are fundamental to be carried out in a balanced manner because these three aspects fully support the duties of humans on earth (See table 1).\nIn the principle of Islamization of science, al-Attas stated that the reason for being human beings is to serve and be Allah's representative on earth. Of all his creatures, only man can perform this task. The purpose of teaching the three aspects of education above is to improve morals and teach man that he has a position as a servant and caliph who must have a healthy physique, spirituality, and an intelligent mind in order to be able to live his life in the world and be happy in the hereafter.\n\nConclusion\nIslamicization of science, according to Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas, is the liberation of man from magical, mythological, animistic, cultural-national traditions (which are contrary to Islam) and from the shackles of secular understanding of thought and language, as well as liberation from the control of his physical impulses that tend to be secular and unfair to the essence of his self or soul, because the man in his physical form tends to forget the essence of the essence his true self, being ignorant of his true purpose, and doing unjust to him. Especially about present (contemporary) science, Islamization means the liberation of science from interpretations based on secular ideologies, meanings, and expressions. The purpose of Islamic education is inseparable from the nature of human creation, which consists of three main components: physical, spiritual, and reason. Islamic education aims to develop these three elements so that a complete human being (Kamil person) is formed so that he can carry out his duties as a servant and caliph in advance of the earth. According to Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas, the concept of Islamization of science is very relevant to the purpose of Islamic education. This can be seen from the compatibility between the concept of Islamization of al-Attas science and the purpose of physical education, reason, and moral education."

              "Resolutions of Conflicts among Radical Beliefs through the Wisdom of Cultural Values\n\n: This study seeks to identify a form of cultural reconciliation applied by the community to the radical belief clash between Dayak Indramayu mysticism and the Muslim community in Indramayu Regency, West Java, Indonesia. This study employed a strategy for resolving cultural conflicts by collecting data via observation and in-depth interviews with both parties. This investigation yielded multiple findings. First, the fight between Dayak Indramayu and Muslims in the Indramayu Regency is a religious dispute. The crisis began when the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) labelled Dayak Indramayu group as heretical. Following the labelling, Dayak Indramayu responded by criticizing Islamic religious leaders who engage in numerous unethical behaviours. Second, although this dispute affected religious leaders on both sides, it had no effect on the religious followers at the grassroots level. Thirdly, religious conflicts involving religious leaders and beliefs can naturally lessen due to the community-owned and religious leader-guided cultural framework. The author identifies this as a cultural resolution to religious problems. This study contributes to two aspects. First, as a model for resolving interfaith problems that can be replicated abroad through the application of cultural values' wisdom. Second, this idea of resolution contributes to the corpus of religious studies on the management of religious conflicts founded in radical views.\n\n\nIntroduction\nCurrent research on the discourse of religious conflict resolution in Indonesia focuses on multiple contexts. Some of them concentrated on religious education (Kusuma, 2018;Moedjiono, 2005), religious tolerance (Wibisono, 2021), and the function of religious leaders (Najib, 2005). Conflict resolution using processes of cultural systems has not been generally practiced (Ode, 2015;Prasojo & Pabbajah, 2020). Whereas religious conflicts typically include the community and involve disagreements in religious views and attitudes.\nSociety is not an abstract concept separate from culture (Narwaya, 2013). Culture and society are inseparable, complementary aspects of a single whole (Asyrafunnisa & Abeng, 2019). Therefore, it is necessary to consider cultural components that they have so far adhered to and put into practice in their everyday lives to understand the conflicts that arise in society, especially religious disputes.\nDayak Indramayu is a contentious form of mysticism among the people since the genuine deity is the universe, and the universe is the one that has provided all of the human necessities for life. However, it is different belief from Muslims in general, who hold the belief that God is the one should be believed and the one who creates the universe as has been conveyed by the prophets through revelation they received. The conflict resulted in such discrimination to the group. Discrimination against the Dayak group is rooted in the Dayaks' unique religious beliefs that set them apart from the rest of society (Nasution, 2013). They received insult and scorn from the society. Finally, the Supervision of Religions and Beliefs (Pakem) of Indramayu Regency has issued a heretical fatwa, the most severe form of public condemnation. Pakem officially decided that the Dayaks should split since they were causing problems for the locals (Ma'mun, 2013).\nThe decision of the Pakem team against Dayak Indramayu indicates that religious divisions in Indonesia are not yet reconciled with the Constitution. Article 28 of the 1945 Constitution (UUD 1945) guarantees religious freedom in its full as a fundamental human right that must be maintained and defended. The judgement against the Dayak Indramayu exemplifies the widespread prejudice against the world's numerous religious sects.\nThis research aims to compare the conflict resolution strategies employed by each group. Therefore, beneficial ideas for reconciling religious tensions in society can be gained from this article. This study examines how Dayak Indramayu and Islamic religious leaders in Indramayu utilize cultural conflict resolution to develop a contemporary relationship model.\n\nMethod\nThe goal of this study is to investigate how the Dayak Indramayu and MUI came to a resolution of their disagreement by drawing on their respective cultural beliefs. Since the violence first broke out in 2007, researchers have been collecting data up until the present day. This was done because, during that span of time, there were multiple stages, beginning with the process of initially issuing issues, moving on to the open conflict phase, having the government intervene by issuing heretical fatwas and dissolving the group decisions in 2012. And finally, the conflict resolution phase and maintaining the results of the decisions until the conflict subsided.\nThis research employs a descriptive analytic methodology. This study employed a qualitative research approach that empirically examines objects, thinks inductively and deductively, explains the entire phenomenon, and draws conclusions from general to specific. In terms of scientific domains, it employs an inter-disciplinary approach that encompasses the sociology of religion and cultural science. A qualitative approach is viewed as a research method that can generate descriptive data in the form of written or spoken words from individuals and observable behaviour (Kahmad, 2000). This research employs both a case study and a life-behaviour method in an effort to concentrate more on the research object.\nObservation, interviews, and documentation were used to collect data utilizing triangulation approaches. This research falls under the category of field research. Observations were made by visiting to the village of Krimun, located in the subdistrict of Kandanghaur, Indramayu regency, and observing every conflict-related occurrence there. Through conversations with the leaders and members of Dayak Indramayu, the data from the observations were confirmed. Multiple interviews were conducted until the data was saturated and no longer changed. While documentation procedures were carried out by collecting books that serve as guides for Dayak Indramayu in performing rituals of worship and interacting with humans and nature, books are also utilized to preserve Dayak Indramayu.\n\nResults and Discussion\nDayak Indramayu is a community that has different beliefs from society in general. They do not believe in God as adherents of other religions believe (Afifah & Soedarsono, 2021;Umam, 2016). Dayak Indramayu believes that the real God is nature. They assume that human life is completely created from nature, and will return to nature. The nature they mean is everything that makes humans dependent on it.\nNature is regarded as the greatest force in life. Nothing is more powerful than the forces of nature. Thus, Dayak Indramayu community seeks to get closer to nature and explore all knowledge and beliefs through a direct learning process from nature and human life. So that this flow can be called a flow of belief that seeks the authenticity of life.\nTakmad 1 is traditionally credited with founding the first Dayak Indramayu martial arts school. This martial arts school (silat) underwent a series of name changes before settling on Dayak as its central tenet. Where, their belief is completely based on the grace of nature, and nothing outside of that.\nNature, according to Dayak, gives life to all living things, including humans, animals, and plants. Through nature, mankind takes advantage of nature's gifts to sustain life. They view the existence of sun as the source of life for all living things, providing them with the energy and strength to grow. Water is a component of nature, the source of life. Without water, living organisms, including people, cannot survive. The elements that nature provides for all living things, especially humankind, are sun, water, soil, and air.\nDayak Indramayu repays nature's generosity by establishing complete obedience to nature through the living principle of sejarah alam ngaji rasa (Umam, 2016). This community embraces the gifts of nature by adhering to the concept of nature's grace. Additionally, their religious practices attempt to respect nature. This belief distinguishes them from other religious devotees in Indramayu Regency.\n\nThe Conflict of Dayak Indramayu\nAccepting religious ideas that differ from those of a religion group is difficult (Ahimsa-Putra, 2012). In addition, it alludes to the existence of God. An individual or religious group will feel endangered or, at the very least, angered by these opposing perspectives. Eventually, these glaring disparities give birth to discriminatory behavior between the dominant and the weak (Hatu, 2010). This kind of practice happened to Dayak Indramayu community in 2007.\nThe dispute between Dayak Indramayu and religious groups as well as the government institutions became visible due to differences in beliefs without mutual understanding. This was signed by the creation of various statements published by both parties evaluating the other party. Conflicts related to the existence of Dayak Indramayu and problematic religious beliefs are mapped and listed in the following table 1. Bakorpakem/ Attorney Issuance of Fatwa that the group is perverted The confrontations between Dayak Indramayu and various government entities in Indramayu District are summarized in Table 1. The nature of the aforementioned conflicts varies according to the areas of activity and topics each organization focuses on. The rivalry between Dayaks Indramayu and the Indonesian Ulema Council of Indramayu Regency is centred on Dayaks Indramayu ' religious beliefs, which are deemed to diverge from Islamic principles. By recognizing that humans were formed by nature and will return to nature, this position rejects the presence and might of Allah SWT, who Muslims firmly hold to be the creator and controller of all life.\nIn Indramayu, the dispute between Dayak Indramayu and MUI is a type of conflict with a very high level of escalation. Due to the fact that this inter-institutional conflict was the genesis of subsequent confrontations between Dayak Indramayu and other government institutions. The MUI's opposition to the existence of Dayak Indramayu gave rise to an extreme stance, namely the proclamation of a heretical fatwa against the Dayak's activities (Jumhari, 2015).\nDayak Indramayu responded to the statement released by MUI Indramayu by questioning the existence of religion in society. According to Dayak Indramayu, religion, as represented by clergy (ulama), frequently demonstrates attitudes that are opposed to their human values and fundamental ethical principles. Such as the incidents committed by Islamic elites in some of their religious institutions by misusing the financial and religious authority over the congregation, as well as by engaging in filthy, like lustful behavior.\nFrequently, Dayak Indramayu consider that the Islamic religious elite cannot offer a example or model for their followers. They illustrate the mentality of a religious elite who requests that individuals pay zakat and alms, yet the religious elite can only communicate and cannot set an example. In reality, there are religious elites who misuse zakat and congregational contributions. For Dayak Indramayu, the approach to religion is unsophisticated because the leaders do not provide a religious role model. Religion is only a mask for the desires of a small privileged group. Similarly, Dayak Indramayu also brought the issue of sexual harassment performed by the religious elite on their adherents. They believe that the religion of the main religious group cannot serve as a guide for its people since its elites frequently engage in unethical behavior.\nCases of abuse and immoral behaviour disclosed by Dayak Indramayu toward the religious elite demonstrate that Dayak Indramayu present themselves as a community that rejects these attitudes. Because they believe that religion should help individuals become better. Utilizing the influence of the religious elite solely to satisfy personal desires is an inappropriate approach. Criticism of religion by Dayak Indramayu, based on the unfavorable attitudes displayed by the religious elite, is an expression of their radical view of their own beliefs and an attempt to fight other different organizations.\nIn addition to the MUI, Dayak Indramayu frequently engage in contest with government organizations. Both village government departments and other government departments. These disputes are either open or resolved. Dayak Indramayu and the village authorities disagree about their identity. There are certain government regulations that this group does not adhere to. They declined to put the religion column on their Identity Cards (KTP) because their religion was not among the six recognized by the government. This prompted the government to take action by censure and summoning its leader, Mr. Takmad. However, this was progressively permitted by the village authority since, according to them, only one member of the Dayak Indramayu tribe, Mr. Takmad, refused to sign a KTP.\nAgainst Islamic religious leaders, Dayak Indramayu frequently questions the role of religion in guarding their followers. And they conclude that seeing religion is only selling its leaders, as mentioned above. The tendency to be critical of the government and religious institutions has made Dayak Indramayu involved in conflict with these two institutions. This conflict led to the issuance of a dissolution fatwa for this group. As a consequence, the Dayak Community must interact with the government through the Institute for Supervision of Community Beliefs (Pakem), a government organization created to fight sects that are regarded deviant or heretical for reasons of unsettling people's beliefs and indicators of belonging to deviant sects.\nMembers  (1) and (2), Law no. 39 of 1999 concerning Human Rights article 22 paragraph (1) and (2), as well as Law no. 12 of 2005 concerning Ratification of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Komnas HAM is of the opinion that the government has no right to restrict citizens from embracing religions and beliefs (Japar, Syarifa, & Fadhilah, 2020). Restrictions can only be made if they are deemed to disturb public order and security, those restrictions must also be carried out or regulated by existing laws.\nA number of non-governmental organizations and humanitarian workers have also been involved in the Indramayu Dayak's fight for full citizenship rights. On a number of occasions, Dayak Indramayu was invited to national and international gatherings centered on religious ideas. There have been numerous scientific studies on Dayak Indramayu culture from a variety of perspectives.\nAccording to this organization, local religious leaders have come around to the idea that their teachings are authentic, but they are afraid to make this information public out of concern for their reputations. Some of the individuals I attempted to question, however, came to the conclusion that not all local religious authorities confirmed this teaching; some considered them as heretical, while others viewed them as kebatinan, depending on the perspective and paradigm of each figure.\nAccording to the justification presented previously, the findings of this study demonstrate that religious radicalism might have multiple interpretations. Let's begin with \"inner radicalism\", which refers to a person's unwavering allegiance to a religious teaching due to a profound belief in the theory's veracity. Almost certainly, all adherents of a certain religion possess something. Because without a strong religious foundation, faith would never amount to anything. Sociologically speaking, this viewpoint will grow more established if those outside the group challenge it.\nSecond, radicalism from the outside (external radicalism) is the typical response of a group whose members hold a strong conviction but also view the ideas of other groups as errors that must be corrected. When radicalism within one group collides with the ideas of another group that is considered as separate, violent confrontations are inevitable.\nThe conflict that occurred between Dayak Indramayu community and outsiders with opposing perspectives proved that the group possessed radical beliefs. This ideology will serve as the impetus for resistance movements when confronted with other different groups. Despite the fact that latent tensions are not always apparent, they are reasonably simple to recognize. And at some time, it will manifest as physical resistance, in the form of attacks or rejections of the rules established by the side viewed as the opponent.\nThe confrontation between Dayak Indramayu and the MUI, the Police, and the Attorney General's Office is obvious and can be defined as follows: 1.\nInitially, a religious movement emerged in a society apart from the dominant group. This action is communal and performed entirely for the group.\n\n2.\nThere are claims that the presence and activity of the new organization disturbs certain parties.\n\n3.\nIt is feared that the group will influence more persons because it is regarded to substantially impact society. 4.\nConcerned groups utilize government authorities to undertake research on these aberrant groups.\n\n5.\nThe majority of studies employ merely the reporter's perspective, without attempting to analyze and understand the reported perspective. 6.\nThe results of the study imply that the reported group will receive the negative stigma and participate in deception. Their paradigm excludes human rights concerns in religious belief. 7.\nThe government responded to the situation by assigning a negative status to the reported group. Until a decision is made to dismantle the considered deviant group. 8.\nThe reported group attempted radical resistance in order to counterattack the opposing party (the reporter and those who assisted). Figure 1 illustrates the concept of a radical behavior anchored in internal beliefs and manifested in actions of resistance in response to pressure from a threatening adversary. Thus, radicalism is not formed in a vacuum; rather, it is the consequence of two factors combining to produce an act of resistance aimed at negating the opponent on both the discursive and physical levels. The adversary (opponent) may appear on its own and constitute a threat, or it may be an invention (imagination) created by a group in an effort to strengthen bonds (solidarity) between groups.\n\nConflicts Resolution among Radical Beliefs through the Wisdom of Cultural Values\nThe fact that the conflict between Dayak Indramayu and the MUI, the Village Government, the Police, and Pakem is public demonstrates that it is an open conflict. According to various national web media reports, this is shown by the ease with which individuals may access information and news about the conflict in the mass media (NU Online, 2007;Suryanto, 2007).\nThe abundance of reporting about the confrontation indicates that the topics being fought over are fundamental. According to Lewis Coser, a struggle between two parties over fundamental problems or ideals will threaten the social stability (Poloma, 2013). The belief in the divine's nature is the essence of religion. If the issue of divinity is litigated, the defendant will respond. In this manner, the MUI organization responded to Dayak Indramayu, which resulted in a heretical fatwa and its destruction.\nOn the other hand, the tremendous intensity of the confrontation between Dayak Indramayu and their adversaries demonstrates that each faction thinks and acts in an extreme manner. This is demonstrated by the attempts made by both sides to refute the views of their respective opponents. The initial attempt to dismiss the perspectives of groups deemed distinct was made. On numerous times, Dayak Indramayu attempts to disparage Muslims, which is offensive. Moreover, this criticism is conducted by challenging the presence of God, which is a fundamental belief for Muslims.\nOn the other hand, the Muslim community represented by the MUI carried out an \"attack\" back on Dayak Indramayu by examining their existence based on the MUI's assessment standards which resulted in heretical decisions or fatwas for the beliefs and activities of Dayak Indramayu. Unquestionably, the MUI based its arguments on a number of Qur'anic propositions. One of the arguments used is the Al-Qur'an (QS.) An-Nisa verse 136 which means, \"Whoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His books, and the day after, then verily that person has gone astray.\" In addition, MUI Indramayu also based their claim on QS. An-Nisa verses 80, 59, 105, and 150-151, as well as several traditions of the Prophet In this context, the efforts made by MUI Indramayu have rooted efforts because they use the main references of Muslims, namely the Qur'an and Hadith.\nSeeing the various efforts made by each group in responding to the other group in an intense manner and basing their judgment on the opposing party on views originating from fundamental references (religious propositions) demonstrates a radical attitude, as both sides attempt to defend their beliefs while attacking the beliefs of the other side.\nThe term radical has a fundamental meaning or gets to the fundamentals of something. In the meantime, radicalism is described as \"thinking or movement that desires social and political transformation or renewal in a severe or extreme manner\" (Yunus, 2017). Thus, we can temporarily conclude that both groups, particularly the Losarang Dayak and the MUI of Indramayu, employed extreme measures in response to other parties (opponents). Then, are they both members of the extreme group?\nAs noted previously, Sartono Kartodidjo developed the term radicalism to characterize the (peasant) protest movement that defied all existing laws and orders while employing religious symbols. Radical signifies a total rejection of all current conditions (Effendi, 1998). Dayak Indramayu and MUI Indramayu's only action was to criticize one party against another. This objection is incapable of serving as a persuasive legal argument due to its nature. In contrast, neither party's actions have reached the mass movement attempting to transform the current order.\nHorace M. Kallen's also proposed an idea of radicalism. According to him, at least three broad characteristics characterize radicalism (Kallen, 1996). First, radicalism is a response to ongoing conditions. Responses typically consist of evaluation, rejection, or even resistance. The rejected concerns may take the form of assumptions, conceptions, institutions, or ideals that are deemed responsible for the continuation of the rejected conditions. Second, radicalism does not end with rejection; it continues to aspire to replace the current system with a new one. This characteristic indicates that radicalism has its own ideology or worldview. Extremists are exerting significant effort to replace the current order with this order. Therefore, according to the meaning of the term radical, a radical attitude requires a desire to fundamentally modify the circumstances.\nThe third characteristic of radicals is their unwavering belief in the reality of the program or ideology they support. This perspective is accompanied by a denial of the realities of the system being replaced. In the name of ideal values such as 'populist' or 'humanity,' social movements frequently mix beliefs about the adequacy of plans or philosophies with tactics of achieving their goals. However, the intensity of this belief may lead radicals to adopt emotional attitudes.\nThe activities of Dayak Indramayu, MUI Indramayu, and other government officials only meet two of Kallen's principles, particularly the first concept, which requires a response to each party's presence. According to Dayak Indramayu, the existence of religious individuals has not established the religion's fundamental principles. Dayak Indramayu would have a tough time believing in an immaterial god, hence there are also criticisms of concepts regarding the concept of divinity. MUI Indramayu has done comprehensive studies in reaction to the presence of Dayak Indramayu, both internally within MUI and in collaboration with other government institutions that are part of the Monitoring Team for Community Beliefs (Pakem).\nNeither group's motions provide credence to Kallen's second proposition, which would seek to alter the status quo. Due to the fact that they can only make formal, discursive decisions and carry them out orally. This commodity is not amenable to efforts to alter each party's social hierarchy, which is a major drawback.\nMeanwhile, it has been shown that Kallen's third statement holds true for both groups: that there is a very powerful perspective that opposes the opposing position. Dayak Indramayu considers their guiding concept in life to be the last, undeniable truth. Many of their actions prove this to be the case. while condemning and denying the truths held by competing groups. When unchecked, this criticism leads to the essential beliefs of its opponents, such as the idea of divinity, the principle of immortality of the genesis of life, and a number of ethical values in life.\nOn the other hand, the MUI provides a comprehensive perspective of its beliefs. Based on the primary arguments that become religious references, the MUI is extremely committed to defending its core values. However, at the same time, they will be forced to confront those who initiate the campaign of latent views entrenched inside their own. A religious mass group issued a fatwa in an attempt to deprive the opposing party in the conflict with Dayak Indramayu the ultimate weapon. In addition, it is common knowledge that religious fatwas issued by religious organizations in a democratic nation like Indonesia cannot serve as a legal basis. It is merely an appeal without the ability to compel.\nViewed from the perspective of Martin E. Marty and R. Scott Appleby, Dayak Indramayu and MUI Indramayu's methods can be categorized as a fundamentalist movement. As expressed by Marty and Appleby regarding fundamentalism's criterion (Martin & Appleby, 1993).\nFundamentalism is characterized by a fighting mentality. Among them is fighting back against groups that threaten their existence or identity, putting their lives at risk. They fight to sustain ideals that pertain to all aspects of life, including the family and other social institutions.\nFundamentalists contend with a framework of values or identities derived from both historical legacies and contemporary constructions. Deviant religious groupings or social structures are therefore also a target of their opposition. Lastly, fundamentalists are distinguished by their engagement in conflict in the name of God or other ideas. The fundamentalist movement's intellectual framework has its own logic. Fundamentalists have a high propensity to reject historical and hermeneutical approaches to interpreting the Bible. In addition to being exclusive, this movement clearly distinguishes its group from other groups. This movement gave rise to what is now known as identity politics.\nAccording to Appleby's perspective, Dayak Indramayu movement is ultimately viewed as the movement that gave rise to identity politics. Similar to Coser, a group's identity will develop as it struggles against the presence of other groups. The author now recognizes that Dayak Indramayu can gain benefits in their religious conflict with the MUI and other government agencies.\nWhat's left of the war? This question should be asked to determine the size of the influence of these social processes. Almost every individual in social relationships relies on others to meet his needs. Protracted conflict will only result in the accumulation of several losses. Social relations between individuals deteriorate, and parties in conflict eventually reach a saturation threshold of conflict.\nSimilarly, Dayak Indramayu and MUI Indramayu, who represented Muslims, engaged in the conflict. The disagreement peaked between 2007 and 2012 and reached a turning point. As previously indicated, when this research was conducted, a significant number of respondents expressed a more tolerant perspective of other competing groups.\nAs pointed out by the following Dayak Indramayu WR adherents: The essence of all religions is excellent, as they teach noble virtues taught by the chosen people of God. Although it will be challenging to perform as instructed by the chosen human. As with the Prophet Muhammad in Islam, the splendor of the Prophet Muhammad cannot be followed by humans so long as his followers continue to pursue religious teachings solely from the sacred scriptures of religion, without relying on their own strength to \"pray the taste\" (WR, Dayak Indramayu follower, Personal Communication, August 26, 2019).\nThis implication suggests two things. First, Dayak Indramayu continue to stick to their own living principles. This is what the author refers to as inner radicalism, a belief that arises from within based on the community's teachings. A determination that has been imprinted for a very long time and possibly will continue to endure for a very long time. Second, the remark demonstrates admiration for other groups. Particularly religious groups that have opposed them in a dispute of beliefs.\nOther evidence indicates that the religious conflict between Dayak Indramayu and Muslims has subsided. This is demonstrated by the mutual understanding between the parties. The author acquired this information from the nearby religious community. According to RR, food vendors in the vicinity of Dayak Indramayu hermitage complex. He stated that his relationship with Dayak Indramayu community was similar to his interaction with regular people. Attendance is guaranteed when each party hosts a celebration and invites the other. So, contrary to what the media has portrayed in previous years, there is no conflict and everything is operating regularly. Regarding deeds, both rewards and punishments are carried by its own individual ( Based on the viewpoints of some of the aforementioned informants, we may conclude that the conflict that once existed between Dayak Indramayu and Muslims is no longer observable in contemporary culture. Each party respects the other's group views and beliefs, so that disagreements are not an issue. The conflict resolution proposed by both parties reveals an observable reality. Both sides have fulfilled a number of conditions for a conflict resolution. Syafuan Rozi outlines four steps in conflict resolution (Rozi et al., 2006, p. 382), they are: 1.\nConflict de-escalation stage.\nThe peace building stage. Dayak Indramayu conflict is unique, and it will not be possible to resolve it using all of the methods outlined above. Stages one and two occur in situations where a high risk of physical harm is present. In Dayak Indramayu setting, the third and fourth stages occur when each party makes the efforts to avoid underlying conflict.\nIn the third and fourth stages, problem-solving approach and peace-building, it can be summed up as each party's desire to try to open up to and appreciate the diverse viewpoints of the other party without attempting to judge them as the guilty party. This has been accomplished by both parties; both Dayak Indramayu and Muslims in Indramayu have acknowledged the existence of the other. In addition, the willingness of each party to create a conducive environment is crucial in conflict resolution. At the stage of peace building, the desired peace activities are refined. Specifically, cultural and structural efforts. In this situation, it takes considerable time to achieve permanent peace. It is essential to anticipate the willingness of parties with authority to act objectively and impartially in dispute resolution (Abdul, 2014).\n\nConclusion\nThe year 2012 marked the height of the religious conflict between Dayak Indramayu and MUI and Muslims in Indramayu. This conflict reveals a specific pattern of extremism. Each side resorted to extreme tactics in response to the actions of the other. Nevertheless, based on the theories offered, it does not represent social radicalism, as shown by efforts to change the order of other parties viewed as opponents. But limited to discourse in the form of an assessment of how the party viewed the opponent. Only the conviction of a life viewpoint retained in the heart is radicalism (inner radicalism). As said, Dayak Indramayu presented a view regarding the behavior of the religious elite that was judged inconsistent with the essential ideals of the faith.\nMeanwhile, the MUI of Indramayu analyzed Dayak Indramayu's behavior and stimuli in great detail. Based on the results of their study, the MUI of Indramayu deemed Dayak Indramayu heretical. This fatwa persuaded the Indramayu Regency's Religion and Belief Monitoring Team (Pakem) to abolish this community. Similar to fatwas and Attorney General's Office judgements, which are vulnerable to multiple interpretations in their application, these decisions remain nonbinding public discourse. Due to the fact that Dayak Indramayu continues to exist and engage in typical activities to this day.\nSince 2012, the conflict has began to decline as a result of many parties taking concrete steps to reduce the dispute, which they believe has had no beneficial impact on human relations. The conflict between Dayak Indramayu and the MUI of Indramayu subsided due to their attempts to comprehend and value one another's perspectives. On the other hand, these initiatives are also supported by the common cultural values of each religious elite on both sides, including both Dayak Indramayu and the Muslims, as represented by local religious leaders.\nThis research has identified patterns of extreme behavior in religious disputes on the north coast from an academic approach. In addition to having disclosed ideas and concrete measures for resolving religious conflicts between groups of the Beliefs and those of the majority religion. For future research, it is proposed to delve deeper into Dayak Indramayu's involvement in practical politics, which has the potential to serve as a wedge between the government and the Dayaks, so that the once-obvious tensions are no longer visible and tend to coexist."

              "Educational Tradition of Ijāzah in Islamic History with Reference to Persian Milieu\n\nFrom the earliest periods of Islamic history and civilization, the educational system was originally religious in nature. It began with the mosque as its centre, from which other educational institutions such as the maktab , the bayt al-hikmah , the majālis , the dār al-‛ulūm , and the madāris gradually developed. In addition, from the vast fields of medicine, astronomy and the devotional sciences emerges the advent of hospitals, observatories, and the zāwiyah within Sūfī fraternities. In the aforementioned educational institutions, students were trained in different fields of Islamic studies that systematically includes both transmitted and applied subjects by their professors. Moreover, they were able to select their professors as they wished. When they had completed their studies, according to a certain level of proficiency to the professor’s satisfaction, they would traditionally be accorded a ‘licence to teach’, a so-called ijāzah , either by one professor or by more than one. It is this ijāzah tradition which has a long history in Muslim education, which deserved special attention where the Persian milieu were part of this tradition right from the beginning; and in some places until the present day. Ijāzah tradition played a very significant role not only among Muslims but also among other religions; therefore, this article studies this unique educational tradition with special reference to Persian milieu.\n\n(the elementary education), 2 the bayt al-hikmah (the house of wisdom), 3 the majālis (the gatherings of scholars and students), 4 the Dār al-‛Ulūm (sing. ‛ilm), 5 and the madāris (sing. madrasah, school or college) gradually developed. In addition, several hospitals, observatories, and the zāwiyah within Sūfī fraternities emerged from the fields of medicine, astronomy and the devotional sciences.\nAfter the expansion of Islam, the number of students gradually increased. In addition, studies concerning the sciences of jurisprudence and the foundations of faith led to the genesis of new scientific disciplines, began to develop rapidly that led increasingly to more vibrant discussion and debate. Study surrounding these new disciplines could not be adequately conducted in the mosques, where one is required to be quiet as a mark of reverence for the awesome significance in the ritual duty about to be performed. Under these circumstances, the aforementioned study-circles gradually relocated from the mosque to other venues, namely the madrasah (plural: madāris). 6 Nevertheless, the distinction between the intellectual functions of the mosque and the madrasah were not apparent, for even after madrasah's were established, the mosques remained as centers of learning much as they had been previously. The distinguishing features between the madrasah and the mosque were very slight. 7 For example, al-Azhar which was founded by the Fātimids in 359 A.H./970 A.D. was originally established as a mosque; later on in 378 A.H./988 A.D. it was formally organized and declared a higher institution of learning.\nWith the augmentation of Islam and the rapid growth and spread of Islamic culture and thought, Muslim scholars began to author various books in the domain of philosophy (falsafah), logic (mantiq), the pure sciences and the religious sciences. In addition, voluminous works containing numerous translations from other languages into Arabic, most notably medical works translated from the Greeks, began to appear. Most of these translations, including original works by the Muslim scholars as well, were used as textbooks and studied in the madrasah's. Ahmad Shalaby, History of Muslim Education, 99-102. 6 Madrasah literally means college. It is a derivation from the verb darasa, meaning \"to read\" or \"to study\". See Ibid. The professors who taught in the madrasah's were accorded specific designations relative to their field of expertise, namely mudarris, shaykh and ustādh. The designation mudarris was the common term reserved for the professor of fiqh (law, jurisprudence). As to the designation ustādh, it was a kind of honorary application, which continues to this day in the Arab speaking countries. As far as its designation in contemporary Arabic use, it is the equivalent of the term 'professor. 9 In the aforementioned educational institutions, students (talaba, tullāb; single: tālib) were trained in different fields of Islamic studies systematically by their professors and were able to select their professors as they wished. Typically, students would study many years under the tutelage of their esteemed professors. When they had completed their studies according to a certain level of proficiency to the professor's satisfaction, they would traditionally be accorded a 'licence to teach' or 'authorization to transmit,' a so-called ijāzah, either by one professor or by more than one. It is this ijāzah tradition which has a long history in Muslim education.\nHaving provided a brief survey on the meaning of education in Islam and its associated institutions, we will proceed with the ijāzah tradition which has a long history in Muslim or Islamic education.\n\nIjāzah as a Unique Tradition in the History of Education\nIjāzah is an Arabic term derived from the root-verb 'ajaza' which means, as Ibn Manzūr states in his Lisān al-‛Arab 10 with reference to the etymological origin, that to \"lean upon\" as on a cushion. Al-Nawawī, in his al-Taqrīb wa al-Taysīr li-Ma‛rifati Sunan al-Bashīr al-Nazīr, says that this verb used to refer to the water which irrigated the fields or satisfied the thirst. 11 Finally, al-Fayrūzabādī, in his al-Qāmūs al-Muhīt, in this regard says to give permission, or licence or authorization. 12 Technically, according to Ibn Manzūr, the noun ijāzah refers to the authorities on whom a student relies to support his claim to knowledge in a particular science. For al-Nawawī, the student asks a professor to give him an ijāzah, that is, to satisfy his thirst for knowledge, and for al-Fayrūzabādī, with regard to education, it refers to giving permission to teach.\nThe term 'ijāzah' in Islamic pedagogy signifies generally a 'licence to teach' or 'authorization to transmit,' and more specifically refers to a certificate issued by a professor in an institution of higher learning to a student who has attended a course of lectures to the professor's satisfaction; and who is deemed worthy and henceforth qualified to teach the same subject to his own students. 13 Thus, the ijāzah was issued by the grantor (al-mujīz, i.e. ‛ālim or professor) who gives licence to transmit from him all what he narrated. Generally, this ijāzah contains of: the title of books or 8 For more detailed information with regard to the titles of other books and their subject matter, see 'Abdul-Jalīl H. 'Abdul-Mahdī, Al-Madāris fī Bayt al-Maqdis fīl-'Asr al-Ayyūbī wa al- Mamlūkī,vol. 1, \"Madrasah\" Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd Edition. compilations of the subjects and a licence is issued along with it. This transmission from the grantor could be either in general or in detail. The chain of transmitters went back until it ended up either with the author of the book, or the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) or others. 14 In Muslim tradition the authoritative character of the transmission derives ultimately from the Prophet, chosen by God to receive the revelation, the religious knowledge (‛ilm) necessary for salvation, passed on to him through the agency of the Archangel Gabriel (Jibrīl). This knowledge the Prophet (SAW) passed on orally to his Companions, and they to their Successors, and they to their successors, and so on, down through the centuries to the ‛ulamā.' Such was the transmission of hadīth accounts relating to the deeds, words and attitudes of the Prophet (SAW), called his Sunnah. The vehicle of this transmission was the spoken word, recited, read aloud, as was the 'Recitation' itself, the Qur'ān.\nThe ijāzah was granted in two ways: orally and written. But, historically the oral way of practice precedes the written one. 15 Before it came to have this broader meaning, the ijāzah was simply one of eight methods of validly transmitting hadīths, being classified lower in the scale of reliability than direct transmission by word of mouth. 16 The muhaddiths are the first to use this term for the sake of science. Because they are the earliest Muslims who gave importance to writing down knowledge. Later on this method was used for the other sciences. 17 The certification was appended to a book, or other writings, certifying that the owner, and perhaps others along with him who were then also named, studied the materials under his direction. The master could also authorize the person(s) named to transmit the contents on his authority as author of the book, or as one who was duly authorized to make the authorization.\nThe ijāzah to transmit hadīth included the authorization permitting others to do the same: authority and authorization were both transmissible. Next to the licence to transmit hadīth, other types of licences developed, like the licence to teach law, al-ijāzah li't-tadrīs. With the development of fiqh (jurisprudence), the licence was no longer primarily for the preservation of hadīth for posterity, but it developed further into a licence to instruct, to teach. 18 These licences to teach (ijāzah, i.e. written) were first issued in Baghdad as early as third century of the Hijrah. And soon, in the fourth century, became a standard universal educational procedure in all the Muslim territories. This procedure was passed afterwards to other subjects; and thus the master would grant a recognized certificate to those students who satisfactorily passed the prescribed course of study under him. During the early period, the ijāzah (licence) was usually written upon the flyleaf of the book studied. Interestingly and uniquely, the authority and competence resided in the ‛ālim, the learned man. When the master granted the ijāzah to teach law, he acted in his capacity as the legitimate and competent authority in the field of law, it was as an individual, not as part of a group of masterjurisconsults acting as a faculty. Throughout its history down to modern times, the ijāzah remained a personal act of authorization, from authorizing ‛ālim to the newly authorized one. The sovereign power had no part in the process: neither caliph, nor sultan, nor amīr, nor qādī, nor anyone else, could grant such an ijāzah. There being no church in Islam, no ecclesiastical hierarchy, no 'university,' that is to say, no guild of masters, no one but the individual master granted the ijāzah. However, no one could legally force him to do so, or to refrain from doing so. The line of religious authority rested, not with sovereign power, but rather with the religious scholars, the ‛ulamā'. Moreover, the institutions in which the ‛ulamā' taught were creations completely independent of the sovereign as such, and in no need of his sanction to come into existence. Indeed the sovereign had no say in the matter of the ijāzah even when he was the founder of the institution. Islamic education, like Islamic law, is basically individualistic, personalist. 20 It is significantly important to state that there were six types of ijāzahs, and they are briefly as follows 21 : 1. The Specific ijāzah: Here the ijāzah is granted by a certain person to another certain person. The four essential parts of this most prestigious type of ijāzah are: the specific mention of the professor's name, his student's name, the subject matter and use of the term ajaztu. 2. The Non-specific ijāzah: Here the professor's name as well as that of the student are mentioned, the subject matter is, however, dropped. Thus, the professor would say that he gave his student the permission to transmit that which the student has studied with him without specifying any book or subject-matter. 3. The General ijāzah: Here the professor's name is mentioned, but his students as a group, without specific mention of their names, are given a general permission to transmit knowledge received from him in a specific subject. 4. The ijāzah on a particular book: This type of ijāzah is very specific; the professor attests that a particular student has studied with him a particular book, or that he has memorized a specific text. Only when the student gives evidence to that effect, he is granted this type of ijāzah. 5. The ijāzah by correspondence: This type of ijāzah is specific to hadīth literature. It is used when an ‛ālim writes down a text and sends it to one or more of his students accompanied by a \"letterijāzah\" permitting them to pass on the knowledge to other students that he has been taught by his mentor. 6. The honorific ijāzah: These ijāzahs are often restricted to ‛ulamā', and are often exchanged among them as a sign of mutual respect and appreciation.\nOne may find variants of each one of these types of ijāzahs. A general characteristic common to all ijāzahs, however, is that they are, as we cited earlier, all personal rather than institutional. This, indeed, is the most outstanding characteristic of certification in Muslim education.\nThe value of ijāzahs to the modern student of Islamic civilization is great. The most important significance of ijāzahs can be reduced to five point, which are as follows: i. They contain a considerable amount of detailed biographical information. The biography of the scholars who transmitted words, attitudes and accounts related to the deeds of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) is narrated with the mention of their names, genealogies, titles and works, in addition to those of their professors who authorized them, and so on. This can be considered as a great source for Islamic bibliographies. ii. They contain a lot of valuable historical information about the scholars, their scientific activities, practices, views and thoughts. iii. They give much information about the cities that were centres of learning and scholarship at particular periods. iv. They reveal the books mostly studied in the cultivation of particular subjects. v. Finally, a picture can be obtained from them about the development of Islamic academic life and its underlying currents of ideas.\nAs it is mentioned earlier in relation to the types of ijāzah, there is an ijāzah called specific ijāzah. In this type, there are genres of ijāzahs in the fields of, primarily Hadīth, and then other fields such as calligraphy, tarīqah (religious order), Sufism, poetry, literature, medical sciences and Islamic sciences. After the development of Hadīth ijāzahs in early Muslim history, all other genres of ijāzah came into existence.\nThe ijāzah on calligraphy with all its various types were granted by the professors to their students for being qualified as a calligrapher or copyist and clerk in the government offices. For this genre of ijāzahs, some examples can be found in al-Muradi's Silk al-Durar fī A‛yān al-Thānī ‛Ashar 22 and in Uğur Derman's Hattat Icâzetnâmeleri. 23 Many students were interested in the mastery of the Islamic calligraphy and obtaining an ijāzah because of the importance of calligraphy in both the government offices and copying the books, when the printing machine did not exist.\nAs for the medical sciences, in the Muslim world the importance of the medical profession was so well realised that from the beginning of the tenth century A.D., physicians had to pass an examination and obtain a certification without which they would not be allowed to practice this profession. For this genre of ijāzahs, we are able to find some examples in Ibn Abī ‛Usaybi‛ah's Tabaqat al-Atibbā '. 24 As the structure and content of the ijāzahs are concerned, we will be provided a general schema for ijāzahs which will include the common characteristics of ijāzahs granted in the Muslim world. With minor exceptions, almost all of them more or less conform to this schema.\n\n\nThe ijāzah invariably starts with the bismillah (the formula \"in the name of God the Beneficent, the Merciful\"), and then continues with the praise to God (alhumdulilah) and the praise to the Prophet (SAW) and his Companions (salwalah).  The praise of knowledge and its importance: Here are mentioned usually those verses of the Qur'ān and hadīths of the Prophet (SAW) which are related to the significance of knowledge, such as the following Qur'ānic verse: \"Say: 'Are those equal those who know and those who do not know? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition'\" 25 ; and the The names of both the student and his professors: Here the grantor of the ijāzah mentions the name of the student to whom the ijāzah is being granted. The moral qualities as well as the academic achievement of the student are described. Besides, the grantor avails himself of this opportunity to express his gratitude to his own professors, thus mentioning his own academic lineage.  The titles of both the books and the subjects on which ijāzah was granted are mentioned.  The chain of transmitters (silsilah) usually goes back to God, except if the ijāzah is on a particular book, then it goes back to the author of that book. However, for the hadīth books, it goes back to the person who collected the hadīths and wrote down, because the hadīths in that book with the different transmitters goes back to the Prophet (SAW). Moreover, mentioning in the ijāzah the name of all transmitters who lived during the period from the Prophet (SAW) to the person who collected hadīths was something very difficult, as the chain of transmission becomes very long and requires great time and writing space. Thus, only some of the names were mentioned.  Then the grantor proceeds to give advice to the student as to how he should use his knowledge; treat his future students exercise his function as a scholar (‛ālim) in the society. He also asks his student not to forget him and requests him to pray for the God's forgiveness.  Finally, the ijāzah normally ends with a prayer, date of issue, and professor's ratification of the ijāzah either by seal or signature, or both. Yet the institution where the teaching has taken place is rarely mentioned. Only if it is granted in an official ceremony, then the place of ceremony is mentioned. Hence, the place can be verified. Besides this, by verifying the name of professor who granted the ijāzah and the date, also the place can be verified. In this way, geographical situation of the Islamic sciences can be described, i.e. where, when, how and which kind of subjects were studied, so the position of that place or district, in terms of political and social relations, comes into light and its role in history can be known.\nNonetheless, it should be clearly mentioned that there are differences between ijāzahs and certificates/degrees/diplomas in the modern age. The ijāzah tradition, as it was mentioned earlier, developed in Islam at least as early as the 4 th century A.H. (10 th century A.D). Almost two centuries later, during the second half of the twelfth century, it made its appearance in the Latin West. It was a license to teach, so-called licentia docendi, the same as the ijāzah. According to George Makdisi, there is not even a single evident showing that education in antiquity, whether in Greece or Rome, did produce the licence to teach. Nor was the licence produced by Eastern Christian Byzantine education, which was a direct continuation of classical education. Nor was it produced by Western Christian Latin education. It first appeared in the West in the second half of the twelfth century, as one of a number of institutions without indigenous antecedents. 28 But Daniel Haneberg, in his work on Islamic education, makes the following statement pertaining to ijāzah: 'I suppose that our licentiate stems from this Muslim institution' 29 . Therefore, there is possibility that the origin of licentia docendi was from ijāzah.\nIn addition, the stages of development of both ijāzah and licentia docendi, according to George Makdisi, are quite identical in nature, and he describes them as follows: From initial training in the literary arts, to embarking on the long course of study leading to the mastership, passing through the ranks of scholar (mutafaqqih) and fellow (faqih), representing the undergraduate and graduate levels, assisting the master as ordinary repetitor (mu'id) or extraordinary docent (mufid), including the work of building up repertories of disputed questions (masa'il khilafiya, quaestiones disputatae), the student practice of quizzing one another (mudhakara, collatio), disputing for practice with fellow students, or with masters in class (munazara, disputatio), disputation based on the confrontation of conflicting opinions (khilaf, sic et non), and the mastery of dialectic (jadal, dialectica), and finally obtaining the licence to teach (ijaza li't-tadris, licentia docendi), and incepting by giving the inaugural lesson or lecture (dars iftitahi, inceptio). 30 There is only one difference that the development of ijāzah in Islam took place more than a century before any part of licentia docendi began in the Christian Europe. This was the early form of certificate in the West. But throughout the history, the term 'licentia docendi' was altered according to the systems of universities into certificate, diploma, degree, etc. Like the case in France, the licence had traditionally been the first degree in France; training for the licence was the central concern of the French system of higher education. However, with the reform of French university diplomas, begun in 1973 and completed in 1976, the position of the licence was altered. 31 Whereas the term ijāzah, in Muslim educational life, remained almost same since it was developed in the early time up today with exception of some areas.\nWe may proceed to present the main differences between the ijāzah and today's certificate or diploma, as a practice. As far as the differences are concerned, it can be reduced into three main differences, and they are as follows 32 : a. Firstly, a unique feature of Muslim education is that Muslim educational institutions were never concerned with the granting of academic certificate. This is essentially the responsibility of the professor concerned, who, upon the termination of teaching a particular subject would certify some of his students, depending on their performance, to apply, teach or transmit the material taught to them to other seekers of knowledge. Neither the seal, nor the approval of the institution where the professor taught were ever solicited. This, in fact, means that ijāzah in Muslim educational practice engaged the responsibility of the professor only. And as long as the professor was conscious of this responsibility, the quality of education and academic standards were in Muslim culture maintained. In contrast to this situation, educational institutions in West, assume fully the responsibility of certification and the granting of academic titles and degrees. The professor's responsibility in this regard is relegated to a secondary position. This practice creates a problem when universities assume a large size and large classes make it practically impossible for the professor to know his students well enough as to engage his direct responsibility in their certification. Thus, the rich intellectual contact between professors and students is often lost. Only at the graduate level the professor-student relation is maintained. b. Secondly, in the ijāzah, in addition to the subjects that have been studied, are mentioned the title of books as well as the chain of transmitters (silsilah) of the book, which goes back to its author. Whereas the diploma or certification mentions only the subjects which have been studied and not the books studied, nor their authors, nor the chain of transmitters for the books. c. Thirdly, the difference in shape. Generally ijāzahs are granted in the form of a booklet which sometimes they contain twenty pages and more. But certificates and diplomas are granted in the form of a scroll which they contain one page only.\nHaving explained briefly the tradition of ijāzah in the Muslim world, now we shall proceed with the ijāzah tradtion in Persian miliue as it is well-known that this tradition in has been widely practiced and still is practiced in the Persian lands and beyond.\n\nIjāzahs in Persian Islamic Educational Tradition\nBefore giving some general remarks about Persian educational ijāzahs, one important point should be borne in mind that in the Persian ones, the person or student is not always granted ijāzah by a Shi'i professor, but sometimes if not mostly by Sunni professors.\n\nConclusion\nAnalyzing the contents of the ijāzahs in Islamic history and civilization, we have clearly noticed the stark differences between both the Islamic and Western systems of education, and the contemporary system of education in the Muslim world at large. While explaining the history and significance of the ijāzah tradition in brief, we have asserted our opinion with regard to the fact that the system of education in the West was borrowed from the Islamic tradition of learning. Similarly, the establishment of universities in the West was derived from the conceptual philosophies inherent to the Islamic tradition. Even the practice of awarding a certificate at the termination of one's study and the associated convocation were traditions adopted from the Islamic tradition. However, while both the institutions of education in the West and in the Islamic tradition emphasize curriculum and methodology, the institution of education in the Islamic tradition primarily emphasizes the scholar who is himself an institution. Similarly, the qualifications of a student in the Western tradition are generally ascertained according to the reputation and intellectual heritage of the institution. On the other hand, the qualifications of a student in the Islamic tradition is primarily established according to the reputation and scholastic authority of the instructor, whose qualifications are authenticated by his instructors who were themselves learned scholars and who in turn ultimately trace their intellectual lineage to the Prophet Muhammad (SAW). In this regard, the instructor must be one whose character and scholastic authority cannot be the subject of doubt. Since what he relates is concerned with truth and justice, his authority cannot be confirmed except by another who is himself an authority, and whose character and scholastic resolve is not receptive of doubt.\nIn this manner, the legitimacy and accuracy of authentic knowledge, both necessary and beneficial, is preserved. In addition, and more importantly, both the systems of education in the Muslim world and in the West rely on epistemology. The epistemology dictating both systems of education is necessarily distinct, made so by the method of interpretation of each respective worldview.\nOn the one hand, one may postulate that the Western worldview develops historically; in other words, it is shaped by a series of successive intellectual traditions each typified by the ideological milieu derived from culture and the passage of science. In essence, it is not one derived from Revelation (wahyi) and is therefore impermanent, dependant upon the persistent formulation of new ideologies. In addition, we maintain that since the Western worldview excludes Revealed knowledge, logically then, there are no fundamental elements as such. In contrast, the worldview of Islam is not one born of culture or social dilemma, nor is it dependant upon the history or the passage of scientific discovery. Conversely it is the worldview itself that gives rise to culture and consequently civilization. In short, it is Revelation which projects the fundamental elements of the worldview, elements whose knowledge is based on certainty. Consequently, one may say that the system of education in the West develops historically, that is to say the curriculum is derived from the ideological milieu which is itself a consequence of culture and the passage of scientific discovery; while the Islamic system of education is derived from the fundamental elements inherent to the worldview of Islam.\nWhat of the current system of education in the Muslim world? One may say that in general Muslim world has recognized the Western system of education. We have been mindful of the fact that the West began borrowing from Muslim institutions as early as the tenth century, and subsequently introduced them to their respective States; among those was the institution of education which then became the foundations for Western scholasticism. Some may argue that by virtue of the fact that the West borrowed from the Islamic tradition, it should be possible to simply adopt Western institutions. Earlier we said that the epistemology dictating both systems of education is necessarily distinct, made so by the method of interpretation of each respective worldview. The West, in borrowing Muslim institutions, interpreted and conceptualized those institutions according to their own worldview, a worldview which, as we have already mentioned, is not one derived from Revelation and is therefore temporal, dependant upon the persistent formulation of new ideologies as dictated by the passage of history and scientific discovery. Therefore, if we now were to adopt those same institutions from the West without first interpreting and conceptualizing those institutions according to the Muslim worldview, one which is characterized by permanence and founded upon certainty by virtue of the fact that it embraces Revealed knowledge, then clearly what results is something incompatible to Islam. For this reason one cannot simply adopt Western institutions en bloc. At the same time however, we do not presume that the institution of education in the West is incompatible to Islam. In addition, one must not presume that the West has nothing 'new' to offer. For example, most curriculums offered in prestigious institutions of learning in the West, are far more mature than those adopted by some 'reputable' institutions of learning in the Muslim world which claim to adopt an Islamic system of education exemplified by the genuine madrasah system. On this note, we are not asserting that the model of the madrasah system does not exist, only that the current purpose and 'philosophy' of the contemporary model does not reflect its original intent. As a result, DEPARTMENT OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION Volume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 the contemporary conceptual understanding associated with the term 'madrasah' is that of religious extremism, backwardness and violence.\nRather than to adopt the original emphasis and purpose of the madrasah system, it would appear that the current system of education in the Muslim world, in particular privatized institutions of higher learning, are more concerned with economic gain. The curriculum in these institutions, appear to emphasize technology rather than science. Ignorance of the sciences will eventually lead to moral decadence and societal discord. Hence, our purpose for introducing this brief work is primarily to emphasize the purpose of education by illustrating the epistemological foundations of the madrasah, and to exemplify the effectiveness of such a system drawing on the ijāzahs of the Ottoman Balkans.\nThe ijāzah tradition, as mentioned earlier, has a long history and was developed by the Muslims at least as early as the 3 rd century A.H. (9 th century A.D). It is an original tradition developed by Muslims under the influence of Islamic sciences such as Hadīth and Qur'ānic exegesis. In the 4 th century A.H., it became a universally applied educational procedure in all the Muslim lands, and had significant impacts on the educational life of the Christian Europe. The ijāzah tradition continued for centuries up to the beginning of 20 th century, and even survives today in some parts of the Muslim world such as Persia and Arabia, but unfortunately not in the Balkans.\nThe various Ottoman Balkan ijāzahs on Islamic sciences we have studied shows the religious, cultural and educational unity of the Muslims in the past, in spite of their geographical differences, as in each part of these Muslim lands, the tradition of ijāzah was more or less same with some minor differences in practice, as it has been shown during our analysis. Besides, there was a linguistic unity as well, for almost all the ijāzahs were written in Arabic, which was the lingua franca in the Islamic world. Even the term ijāzah (and its variation ijazetname) has remained the same in almost all over the Muslim world, but the term licentia docendi which was the early form of certificate in the Christian Europe, in contrast to the Muslim world, it was altered throughout the history according to the systems of universities into certificate, diploma, degree, etc.\nThe ijāzahs reflect the Muslim world-view and ethical values as well. They were not mere documents showing the students' qualifications; rather, as we saw, they contained praise to God, His Prophet and knowledge, and statements about the importance of knowledge and of ethical values such as humility, love and respect for knowledge and scholars.\nAll the ijāzahs contain chain of transmitters for the subjects, showing the source of knowledge ending up with the scholars of the past. Sometimes, especially in the subjects of Qur'ān and Hadīth, this chain went as back as to the Prophet or the Almighty Allah. This openly shows the great influence of the Hadith methodology upon the ijāzah tradition. In addition, it had an important consequence: the professor was more important than the institute, for it was the former who granted the ijāzah, in contrast to the Western practice. However, this did not mean that the procedure and the requirement for ijāzah -granting were arbitrary; rather as the documents of ijāzah and the historical information show, the professors were conscious of their duties and responsibility, and the quality of education and academic standards were maintained to a great extent. Moreover, the information on the transmitters and the knowledge they transmitted is a valuable source for the modern researcher as well. Finally, our study also shows that the Persians were part of this tradition and that they contributed to it by establishing madrasahs and other centres of learning and producing many scholars.\n\nBibliography Published Ijāzahs\nThe"

              "Critical Analysis of the Works by Fredrik Barth, Akbar S. Ahmed, and Charles Lindholm on Swat Pashtuns\n\nThis paper focused on analysing the three very famous ethnographic works on Pukhtun Society of Swat. First, the work of Fredrik Barth “Political Leadership among Swath Pathans, was analysed then analysis of counter work to Barth’s done by Akbar S. Ahmed, “Millennium and Charisma among Pathans”, then there was critical review of the work by Charles Lindholm “Frontier Perspectives: Essays on Comaritive Anthropology”. Works of Louis Dupree, Talal Asad and Micheal Meeker, have also consulted to critically analyse the works of the mentioned authors. This paper is an effort to examine the fact that the works of Fredrik Barth, Akber S. Ahmed, and Charles Lindholm present partially true picture about the socio-economic settings of Swat Pashtuns but not a fully appropriate, impartial and correct image of that society. If one would fully depend on these works to understand the economic and political circumstances of Swat society, then it would be probably insufficient and misleading owing to a significant difference in the writings of all these writers though written from the same society. It means that all of them were writing from the different positions, from separate cultural, educational and professional backgrounds. Their backgrounds have great influence on their writing, which made their work subjective and biased. Thus, it assumes that though an anthropologist tries to remain impartial and objective while writing about any culture, he cannot be, because of his cultural restriction. So, there is an effort to give an answer to the research question by applying the idea of post-modernist approach of James Clifford “writing culture”, also\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Swat Valley is a narrow, green agricultural valley at the western side of the Himalayas, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan, bordering on Afghanistan. At the time of Barth's study in the early 1950s, its majority population was Muslim, although it was sufficiently non-egalitarian society that caste was a salient principle. Pakhtuns were monopolized on the land and politics of the Swat at that time. Pakhtuns were consisted upon 20% of the total population. They were powerful and administrators. All non-Pakhtuns, except the Saints, were clients and working tenants of the Pakhtuns. The Pakhtun chiefs collected rents of 3/4 to 4/5 of tenant harvest, which they used on hospitality, gifting, and lending. Other than Pakhtuns land-lords, The Saints or Sufis were other influential figures in the Swat area based on their Islamic virtues of piety, learning, and sanctity.\n\nFREDRICK BARTH\nFredrik Barth is a Norwegian scholar, whose life and career has taken him throughout the world. He was born in Germany and he got his early education in Norway. After receiving an M.A. at the University of Chicago in 1949, he began doctoral studies at the London School of Economics under Edmund Leach. He did fieldwork in Swat from February to November, 1954, with funding from the Royal Norwegian Research Council. While Barth was doing his field work his supervisor Leach was appointed as lecturer at Cambridge University. Thus, Barth followed him there, and completed his doctoral thesis, \"The Political Organization of Swat Pathans\" in 1957. His monograph titled \"Political Leadership among Swat Pathans\" is based on his thesis.\n\nPolitical Leadership among Swat Pathans by Fredrik Barth\nPolitical Leadership among Swat Pathans by Fredrik Barth is based on his field work in 1954, is circulated around the organization of Swat society on the basis of genealogies and economic basis. He evaluates that how the authority and corporate groups emerge out of personal relations. The first two chapters set forth the problem of the book, and the general ecology and ethnology of the area. Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the social organization of the people: underlying frameworks of caste, consanguinity, neighborhood, and affinity, Chapters 5-9 deal with political organization: inequality and authority, land tenure and political relations, chiefs, saints, alliances and blocs. Chapter 10 is a brief political history of Swat. After a concluding chapter, there are appended cases of blood feuds. (Krade, 2009) More specifically, in his work, Barth attempted to describe the political structure of Pashtun society in the Swat valley. Mutual aspects of patron-client bonds are demonstrated in such contractual relationships as those between tenant and landowner and between crafts persons and village farmers. The focus of political authority is on landowners or those who have rights to land and who preside over a men's house (hujra). Bonds between Saints and their followers are also said to constitute patron-client units. The ability to command a large following signals to rivals that an army can be mobilized should disputes escalate into warfare. Barth asserts that the contractual relationships between leaders and their dependents underlie the territory's political system and the establishment of social order within it.\nThough, Fredrik Barth's \" Political Leadership among Swat Pathans\" is a classic example of \"methodological individualists\". Somewhat anticipated against E. E. Evans-Pritchard's who expressed social structure as the key to understanding political relationships in tribal societies, Barth emphasized the role of individual initiative and choice in the creation of political authority. In shifting attention from social structure to the individual, Barth's work is a critical milestone in the development of anthropological theory, presaging the rise of European Journal of Philosophy, Culture and Religious Studies ISSN 2520-0445 (Online) Vol.6, Issue 2, pp 42 -51, 2022 www.ajpojournals.org 44 rational choice and practice theory. Barth's study of the Swat Pathans in Pakistan also generated an interesting debate within anthropology. (Edwards, 1998). But his methological individualism approach also got a lot of criticism and has challenged by many scholars, i.e, Akbar S. Ahmed, Talal asad Louis Dupree, Micheal Meeker etc.\nHis cultural and education background has great impact on his interpretation of Swat society. Firstly, the title of his book \"Political Leadership among Swat Pathans\" is questionable because the term \"Pathan\" is an Anglo-Indian terminology, which has negative connotation in Pashtun society. (Ahmed, Pukhtun Economy and Society (Routledge Revivals): Traditional Structure and Economic Development in a Tribal Society, 2013) It is generally regarded as unacceptable in Pashtuns. (Hart, 1982). Secondly, his individualistic approach or more probably rational choice theory is not relevant to the societal structure of Swat. In this way, he is viewing the political and economic structure of Swat through the lens of Western individualistic model as Barth said, \"…in systems where no choice is offered, self-interest and group advantage tend to coincide, since it is only through his own group that any individual can protect or improve his position. Where, on the other hand, group commitments may be assumed and shed at will, self-interest may dictate action which does not bring advantage to the ; and individuals are able to plan and make choices in term of private advantage and a personal political interest.in this respect the political life of swat resembles that of western societies\" (p.2) (Barth, 1959) Here, Barth remains unable to understand the basic structure of the Swat society. As he said \" Our central problem then is to explore the kinds of relationship that are established between the persons in Swat, the way in which these may be systematically manipulated to build up positions of authority, and the variety of politically corporate groups which result\". (Barth, 1959) Talal Asad challenge the Barth's focus on free choice as the central operating principle of Swat society. In contrary to Barth, Asad view is that it was not free choice but the presence of a sovereign landowning class that was the key to political leadership in Swat. The system does not regulate itself as it were after the consent of all participants has been obtained. It is regulated by a dominant class of landowners who exploit the landless. Once the agrarian class structure is recognized as the basic political fact... it becomes no longer possible to represent the political system as essentially made up of opposing blocs in dynamic equilibrium, a system which is simply the result of a multitude of choices (p.82) (Asad, 1972).\nThe main focus of Barth works is khans, who have authority on his subordinates on the basis of land. Traditionally, a chief's area of authority was temporary, in large part because of the custom of periodic land redistribution, but even with the end of land redistribution, Barth indicated that there was considerable flux in the composition of different factions because of the changing fortunes of individual chiefs and the continuing ability of followers to shift their allegiance to a different leader. The second focus of Barth's concern was with leaders he referred to as \"Saints\" whose authority is premised on their association with Islam. In contrast to khans, whose success requires a reputation for self-assertiveness and ruthless defense of their interests, well-regarded saints will have established a reputation for \"moderation, piety, indifference to physical pleasure,\" as well as \"wisdom, knowledge, and control of mystical forces\" (p.101) (Barth, 1959). Cultivation of these qualities, along with a dignified, pacific manner and disciplined observance of Islamic rituals, confirms villagers' respect for saints; in some cases, saints inspire awe and veneration. In Barth's words, a reputation for holiness.\nBarth views the Swat society with the view of Khans. At the one hand he divided the whole Swat society into non-landed class (tenents and their followers) and their network of  (Barth, 1959). Non-landed class is not only dependent on landed class for their livelihood, but also for taking loans and protection. They are not free in taking any kind of socio-political decisions.\nOn the other hand, Barth is viewing swat enterprise through the Norwegian angle, in which a man is very calculated in cost and revenues. He sought ways to maximize his profit and minimize his loss. He has multiple choices and strategies to get ultimate political power (Louis Dupree, 1977)\". The Yusufzai khans who balance each other in power to ensure some form of rough equilibrium, while all the time maneuvering to join an alliance or bloc ('dalla') that would lead to an advantageous position, and therefore maximizing power over the rival bloc of khans\". ( In addition, Barth only focus on the urban economic structure, while he did not explain the rural society of swat, or people living in the highland areas of Swat. Resultantly, he did not explain the role of saints and Sufis on the lives of people in those areas. \"An inevitable khan's eye-view of politics enters Barth's analysis of Swat society, which partly explains the 'minimization' of the impact of the wali on Swat society and exaggeration of the role of Khans\". (Ahmed, Millennium and Charisma among Pathans: A Critical Essay in Social Anthropology, 1976) He overlap the terms saint, wali, pir, and mullahs, likewise he did not differentiate into the term chief and khans in Swat. (Charpentier, 1977) Saints are spiritual bodies who do not have any interest in getting profit in this world, while mullahs whom Akbar said \"Barthian man\" mostly work in the interest of khans to get monetary profit.\nLeadership in Swat society has been divided into Khans and Saints. Had Barth further subdivided the categories of religious leaders into orthodox (Mullahs, Sayyeds Mians) and the unorthodox (Sufis like the Akhund)….the 'orthodox mullah' (and also Barthian Saints) work within the village social organization, and in practice with the good will of the khans, the Sufis works outside the village organization and established normative patterns of social behavior (Ahmed, Millennium and Charisma among Pathans: A Critical Essay in Social Anthropology, 1976).\nAlthough, Barth apply individualist method to understand Swat political leadership, but there is not congruence in theoretical approach and empirical data. His model do not have explanatory strength about the true picture of the Swat society. As Asad has said \"… together with evidence about village and kinship loyalties among Swatis in general, must render inadequate the market-type, individualistic, contractual model as the basic analytic framework for understanding the total political structure of Swat\" (Asad, 1972).\nAnother flaw of Barth work is that he just illustrated self-balancing side of society while he did not demonstrate the degenerative side of Swat society. …Anthropologists are not been able to gauge the extent to which a tradition was the product of irresolvable disruptive processes. Unable to perceive degenerative processes in political experience that are out of control, anthropologists have not fully appreciated the darker side of institutions as a temporary stabilisation of injustice in the form of organised violence…. Fredrik Barth is usually considered an eminent critic of structural-functionalism and a thorough realist about the  (Meeker, 1980) This was the critical review of the Barth work. Now there will be a critical analysis of Akbar S. Ahmed book \"Millennium and Charisma among Pathans\", which is a counter work to Barth's work.\n\nAKBAR S.AHMED\nAkbar S. Ahmed was working as political agent in Orakzai agency of the federally administered tribal agencies (FATA), Pakistan. Due to serving as government official he get reach to the internal knowledge of these areas. He was also the husband of granddaughter of Wali of Swat.\n\nMillennium and Charisma among Pathans by Akbar S.Ahmed\nHis book \"Millennium and Charisma among Pathans\" first published in 1976, which presents an analysis of the Swat Pathans, the people of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan, who belong administratively to Pakistan despite being a fiercely independent group, with their own codes and ways of life. Akbar S. Ahmed, who knows the Swat Pathans well through his family connections, presents a clear and sophisticated analysis of their complex society. The study provides an anthropological and critical re-examination of the ethnography of the Swat Pathans and the author suggests specific alternative models of social organization.\nThe book also represents an important contribution to the general debate in the social sciences between the 'methodological individualists' and the 'methodological holists', and challenges some of the theoretical and methodological premises in anthropology. He believes that the 'Swat models' have inadvertently become the basis for generalized, and often incorrect, understanding of models of Pathan socio-political organization in the social sciences (Ahmed, Millennium and Charisma among Pathans: A Critical Essay in Social Anthropology, 1976).\nHe criticizes the work of ferdrik Barth on the basis of three points. First, ethnological ethnocentricity; According to Ahmed Barth interpret swat society through the angle of Norwegian entrepreneur, in which returns exceeds costs. Secondly, Barth is generalizing Yusufzai Culture on whole of the Swat society as a norm, though they are a minority. Thirdly, Khans remain stuck in maximizing their interests not the bulk of the people. (Louis Dupree, 1977). Ahmed work gives a good analysis of Barth's work. His work is also not fully true about the society of swat Pashtuns and in many aspects his work is also questionable. When he attack on Barth's idea of transactionalist saying it as Norwegian entrepreneur imposing on the Pashtuns .he said that, this idea could be relevant to khan landlord and tenants structure (in qalang area) but it cannot fully apply on Nang areas where people are under the great influence of Sufis. They do various humane acts not to get material advantage but to get spiritual gain.\nIf the Barthian landlords are busy 'seizing', 'attacking' , 'manipulating' and 'ousting' they still represent only activities of a small percentage of the total population.it is difficult to envisage the small Pathan landlord or a peasant 'attacking' and 'seizing' with impunity. Certain behaviour of pathan behaviour can be understood mainly in terms of mystical sufi behaviour. The imposition of the transactionalist framework, in toto, on the Swat pathan Moreover, Ahmed challenges the concept of Barthain Saint by adding that these are the men who maximize their worldly benefits by aligning with khans. Wherever, Sufis are those who do not have any concern with material gain of this world. According to Ahmed Barth wrongly use the idea of saints. He said that lose of this world is gain for Sufis. To comprehend a Sufi frame of reference in Barthian 'transactionalist' term (such as 'manipulating', 'maximizing', 'strategizing'- Barth, 1966) is to fail to understand the dominant element in sufi consciousness and the cognitive values as seen through sufi eyes; it is also to impose a sterile sociological framework of analysis and the reference. There is a polarity of difference in the two vocabularies and even in the definition of similar concepts. (p.88) (Ahmed, Millennium and Charisma among Pathans: A Critical Essay in Social Anthropology, 1976) Here there is no contradiction between Barth's \"self-interest\" position and Ahmed's holistic \"social matrices\". Because though interest of two categories of people are different and conflicting, as one category prefer to maximize worldly or material gains while other category prefer to have spiritual gains, but both kind of people are competing for maximizing their own individual interests. So, in this way Ahmad is wrong in criticizing Barth idea of transactionalist. In another way Ahmad unfairly criticize Barth by saying that he adapted Norwegian entrepreneur lens to view Swat economic and political system. Individualistic gains and materialistic behaviour is not restricted to Western capitalist societies. It can be found in the countries all over the world. Though, Barth's idea of material gain is appropriate in case of mullahs, khan and political leaders either do not apply on the whole of the Swat society.\nMoreover, as Ahmed criticize the work of Barth saying that he overemphasize on the conflict arising behaviour of land-lords, but in view of Micheal Meeker Barth correctly insist on the forceful and conflicting behaviour of khans. Limitations of Barth's analytical paradigm have led to inaccuracies in his description of political experience in Swat; nevertheless, it is concluded, his book remains a good ethnography of Swat overall….Barth correctly insist on the role of pragmatic and rational strategies in connection with the use of force and a resort to coercion (p.685) (Meeker, 1980). Ahmad also overemphasis on the self-less and interestless kind of Sufis and, as he said they are not men of this world. But in some way saints and Sufis also were entangled in the logic of enhancing its own power with compare to the other Sufis of the Swat. They were also competing with each other for getting more influence and prestige among more and more people.\nSaints have a place in Swat, because chiefs are devoted to force. But Saints themselves are not free from the pervasiveness of the logic of power in Swat. As leaders of followings, as competitors with other saints with followings, and as men whose role as peace-makers require them to exercise authority over chiefs, they too are tainted by a quest for influence and prestige. They are men of peace in principle, but not altogether in fact (p.697) (Meeker, 1980). Moreover, Ahmed is not correct in dividing the society into two categories Nang and Qalang Pathans. Nang society is not like that which is fully and constantly remain under the influence of saints and Sufis. In this way Ahmed ignore the change and development in the society under the influence of capitalism and globalization.As Charles lindholm in his article said that swat society has greatly transformed under the influence of regional and international changings (Lindholm, Swat in Retrospects: Continuities, Transformation and Possibilities).\nEuropean Journal of Philosophy, Culture and Religious Studies ISSN 2520-0445 (Online) Vol.6, Issue 2, pp 42 -51, 2022 www.ajpojournals.org In summarized way, Ahmed superimposed the heroic behaviour of saints or Akund on the Swat society. One can see his personal biasness and cultural context in this regard. As he was not an anthropologist but he was a political agent and he was also the husband of granddaughter of Wali of Swat. So, in this way he exaggerated the personality and influence of Wali on the lives people.\nIn short Akbar S. Ahmed gives much romanticized image of Swat Pushtuns. He exaggerated and caricaturize the Pashtun wali (a cultural identity comprises of many positive and negative conducts) on the whole Pashtun society which is a generalized form of cultural code and stick to Pashtuns as a sign of pakhtuness. Although there is nothing substantial or ideal sort of moral character which could be fixed to a whole society, because societies are comprise of people, and there is vast division and distinction among people, moreover, there is no cultural facts, economic and sociological interventions always remain there. But I think there is a mystification under the pakhtun wali cultural code. As Akbar, Barth and lindholm gave much importance to some cultural characteristics specific to Pashtun society i.e. honour, Turborwali, hospitality, Hujra, Jirga and egalitarianism etc, though these kind of things are also present in many other ethnic groups in more or less in the same form i.e. in Punjab there is also concept of \"sharika\", which is alike turbors, Panchayat system is also prevail in Punjab which is alike Jirga in Pukhtuns and \"Dara\" Hujra kind of place but as cultures remain changing and these kind of traditions have also changed to some extent.\nMoreover, there is also hierarchy in Pashtun society that is also not fully egalitarian.…there are no landlords and tenants, no master and slaves, no ruler and ruled. A certain hierarchy and inequality exist in society between men and women, senior and junior lineage and pukhtun and non-pakhtun, but they are not based on deterministic economic factors or ritual and commensal ones (p.358) (Ahmed, Pukhtun Economy and Society (Routledge Revivals): Traditional Structure and Economic Development in a Tribal Society, 2013).\nAccording to Charles lindholm, if Akbar blamed on barth to overemphasis on the violence and individualism in Pashtuns of Swat, then ahmed himself exaggerate the unity and organization in Islamic society. It seems that these contrasting images pose a real problem for anthropological analysis, a problem which is perhaps best dealt with by going back to the source, that is, to the colonial reports and ethnographic themselves. The men who wrote these documents has their own particular interests in mind as British Raj attempted either to dominate or to accommodate the renellious Pathan people of the north-western border in what is now Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan.(p.4) (Lindholm, Frontier Perspectives: Essays on Comparative Anthropology, 1996).\nFurthermore, everyone of this ethnographer did fieldwork on Yusufzai Pukhtuns of Swat which are a minority there and they are not native there. Thus, to generalize their cultural acts on the whole of the population of pukhtun in Swat is not true, which would be misleading and inappropriate.\n\nFrontier Perspective; Essays in Contemporary Anthropology by Charles Lindholm\nIn his book \"Frontier Perspective; Essays in Contemporary Anthropology\" he use various such terms which shows that he is writing under the influence of orientalists prejudices.\nI also discuss the problem of the assimilation of Muslims, who believe in human equality, into Hindu caste system, wich ranks occupational categories….i am making a claim that an understanding of a tribal Islamic society such as Swat is worthwhile not only in itself, but also a means for gaining a wider comparative understanding of larger world systems.in particular, I want to draw attention to the fact that even Swat is a small world that has much in it that we often think of as Western and modern: (p.ix) (Lindholm, Frontier Perspectives: Essays on Comparative Anthropology, 1996).\nAs he used the terms Hindu Caste System, Islamic society and Western and modern, this give an expression of Orientalist approach \"we and they\", which makes him biased and subjective to some extent. Moreover, when he compare Swat Pukhtuns characteristics with Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, it seems that he is writing with some specific preperceptions and generalizing some characteristics to whole Middle-East Central Asia and South Asia. Though he did field work only in specific areas of these regions. Furthermore, Charles accused Akbar and Barth that they used colonial sources in their work, but he himself used the term \"Pathan\" for Pashtuns in many places which is a colonial term. Moreover, he also views the Swat society through an ideal angle of Pukhtunwali.\nThe 'true pukhtun' is proud and fearless, courageous in warfare (wether inside or outside the home) and generous to the guest; he (or she) prefers death to dishonour, and though he might lie, cheat and steal, he will never beg; he values his independence above all else and never submit to the domination of others; he upholds the tenets of Pakhtunwali…  , 2013).whereas there is no truth in cultural settings. Existent structures and institutions are built on discursive discourses on the bases using power and knowledge. There is no way to come out of structural and cultural discourses. Discourses are presented as truth in structures, and they are transferring within generations through individuals (p.13) (Phillips, 2002).\nOur knowledge of the world should not be treated as objective truth \"….our ways of understanding the world are created and maintained by social processes (Burr 1995: 4;Gergen 1985: 268). Knowledge is created through social interaction in which we construct common truths and compete about what is true and false. Within a particular worldview, some forms of action become natural, others unthinkable. Different social understandings of the world lead to different social actions, and therefore the social construction of knowledge and truth has social consequences…. (p.6) (Phillips, 2002)\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhole above mentioned debate was an effort to reach at the conclusion that there is no any substantial truth about cultures, and one cannot reach to the total reality on the basis of anthropologists' findings. Anthropologists can present a \"Partial Truth\" after inclusion and exclusion of knowledge about a specific culture. Ethnography is actively situated between powerful system of meaning.it poses its questions at the boundries of civilizations, European Journal of Philosophy, Culture and Religious Studies ISSN 2520-0445 (Online) Vol.6, Issue 2, pp 42 -51, 2022 www.ajpojournals.org 50 cultures, classes, races, and genders. Ethnography decodes and recodes, telling the grounds of collective order and diversity, inclusion and exclusion (p.2) (Clifford, 1990).\nDiscourses are deeply embedded in systems and structures, under which we are functioning without questioning the. These powerful discourses have become normative patterns and it is very difficult to though out of them.…In a society such as ours, but basically in any society, there are manifold, relations of, power which permeate, characterise and constitute the Social body, and these relations of power cannot themselves be established, consolidated nor implemented without the production, accumulation, circulation and ~functioning of a discourse (p.93) (Foucault).\nMoreover, James Clifford's argument is very appropriate and strong in explaining the phenomena. He is a post-modernist thinker and argues that ethnographies, to date, are not objective. Therefore ethnographies should be considered a type of literature and a form of art. According to him ethnographies are fusion of literary theory and ethnography. Ethnographies are \"situated between powerful systems of meaning\". Ethnographies are inherently subjective because they are interpretations of a culture by an anthropologist. Therefore, they should not be considered scientific or objective, because ethnographers use knowledge of their own culture in order to evaluate another culture (Clifford, 1990). Ethnographies are artifacts in which author plays a significant role while writing them. They construct knowledge on the bases of ethnographic data. Thus, while ethnographer writes about a culture his background reflex in his writing, he cannot become free of his socio-cultural luggage. In this way ethnographic writings could be called as fiction as they are \"something made or fashioned\" (p.6) (Clifford, 1990)."

              "Traces of Western Philosophy in the Media’s Islamophobia Discourse\n\nIslamophobia, which started with the first emergence of Islam but has become a common concept, especially after the September 11 attacks, is one of the most common forms of discrimination that Muslims are subjected to today. Although it means fear of Islam, Islamophobia refers to unfounded fear. The media plays an important role in spreading and reinforcing this fear or prejudice. Islamophobia, which is usually dealt with on a theological basis in the studies carried out, actually has philosophical foundations and this has a more ancient history than theological foundations. So much so that when we look at the anti-Islamic content produced in the media, it is seen that there is a great similarity with the descriptions in Western philosophy. For example, in addition to similar depictions such as Islam being a \"religion of the sword\", which is constantly associated with terror, the fact that Islam is a religion that emerged from Eastern society has led to a philosophical depiction mixed with orientalist images. This study, in which the document analysis method is used, reveals that the Islamophobic discourses and representations produced by today's Western mainstream media organizations are very similar to the depictions and judgments about Islam and Muslims from the Medieval philosophy to the period of Western thought from the Age to the period of Western thought."

              "Methodological features of the study of Russian cosmism in Russian culture\n\nThe article examines the original phenomenon of Russian cosmism, generated by the culture of the Gorbachev period of «perestroika». Russian cosmism is an original synthesis of scientific ideas, religious and philosophical insights, as well as poetic and artistic penetration into the mysteries of the cosmos. The article shows the limit of applicability of the concept of «Russian cosmism» to Russian philosophy, poetry and ballet. In a number of research works, a «circular» error was revealed when substantiating the involvement in «Russian cosmism» of musical works, ballet, painting and literature based on the content of the ideas of the philosophy of cosmism in them. The article shows that in the era of the Silver Age, philosophers, scientists and writers did not realize the commonality of the ideas of «Russian cosmism». The article proves that one can speak about the philosophy of Russian cosmism only with the advent of critical philosophical reflection on the foundations and principles of the corresponding school – participants in scientific Readings in memory of K. E. Tsiolkovsky realized the presence of a group of Russian thinkers-cosmists only in the late 60s of the XX century. It is shown that Russian cosmism finally acquires its essence only during the years of Gorbachev’s «perestroika», when it becomes a new Russian «saving» ideology for the entire world."

To achieve the goal, he not only gave the degenerate nation a new direction of thought and action with his insight and intelligence, Rather, they were attracted towards the acquisition of modern sciences in order to regain their lost position and join the honorable nations.Sir Syed awakened the sleeping nation with his dedication, sincerity, selflessness and intellectual and practical power and led them on the path of knowledge and action. Knowing modern scientific and English sciences as the cause of development, Sir Syed made it necessary to acquire these sciences and tried to harmonize Islam and religious sciences with the latest ideas and philosophies that continue to this day.The publication of Tehzeeb-ul-Ikhlaq and the establishment of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College were Sir Syed's modern ideas and views. It is a proof of this. Through this paper, Sir Syed's modern thought and vision will be presented, which can be a beacon for a nation even today."

              "TRANSFORMATIONS OF MOTIVES OF RELIGIOUS DRAMA IN THE LITERATURE OF THE 20TH-21ST CENTURIES: THE PHILOSOPHIC ASPECT\n\nThe article studies the transformation of motives of religious drama in the literature of the 20th-21st centuries from the point of view of religious philosophy, namely the neo-Thomism paradigm. The concept of transformation is interpreted as a transition to the use of meaning-generating models close to drama as a kind of literature in the context of the visual turn in the culture of the 20th-21st centuries. The actualization of action as a form-creating means along with the explicit or implicit accentuation of the integrity of the world picture is interpreted as a search for metaphysical grounds for the aesthetic systems of modernism and postmodernism and the poetics of individual authors and their works. The article substantiates the philosophical aspect of the interpretation of religious drama accepted in scientific literature as a metagenre for the literature of the 20th-21st centuries. The study outlines the universal character of generic methods and means of expressiveness of religious drama for literature in the conditions of the visual turn. \nThe aesthetics of literature between phenomenological and metaphysical approaches to human action may be inclined to the fluctuation (metaxis) between them, which conditions the stylistic and genre openness of religious drama. In this context, its elements are used both in traditional genres and to rethink the genre and stylistic boundaries of the representation of human action in art in general and in literature in particular. Motives of religious drama (journey, overcoming obstacles, battle, feat as a leap of faith, love, despair, hatred, boredom as existential aspects of the human condition, service, sacrifice) in the works of P. Claudel, H. Chubai and D. Barthelmy are presented with significant differences, but with the preservation of paradigmatic features – symbolism and metaphysics as an indication of the ultimate integrity, unattainable neither rationally nor sensually. The universalism of the motives of religious drama is interpreted as the present ambivalence, which brings together high and low, profane and sacred, parody and grotesque with pathos, etc."

              "Interreligious Dialogue: Revisiting Comparative Theology for Social Harmony in Pluralistic South Africa\n\nThis article examines and explores the importance of interreligious dialogue within the multireligious and multicultural communities. The dialogical tool to be used in this endeavor is Comparative Theology. Through the literature review, the scenario of religiously diverse communities, especially in South Africa, is painted both historically and sociologically. Comparative Theology is defined and historically identified. Theology of dialogue is brought forth as a method that Comparative Theology can use towards social harmony in pluralistic South Africa. Social harmony as a sociological anticipation is defined and related to theology. Social harmony is presented as the form of collective philosophy, which means working together for the greater good, and putting the societal or organisational needs above and ahead of the needs of an individual. The intention is not to convert but to understand and see how harmonious coexistence can be initiated and achieved. Interreligious dialogue is not an initiative of weighing error from truth. It is an engagement with the other, and as dialogical partners coming from \ndifferent traditions, Comparative Theologians provide guidelines towards this dialogue. Reflective suggestions are highlighted, and these are networking and partnership development for human survival. Christ’s example of crossing the cultural and religious barriers is elaborated as a model to follow. Contact without contamination is the driving force. Disengagement and personal insulation are not an ideal option. Christian theologians are encouraged to engage dialogically with people of different religions, as dialogue is the better option towards understanding of the other."

              "The Idea of the Overman in F. Nietzsche’s Philosophy: New Values Beyond Humanity\n\nIn the light of the contemporary post-humanist discourse and tendency towards rejecting the idea of the subject in Western European philosophy, Nietzsche’s concept of the Übermensch (overman) appears to be an integral part of discussions on the anthropological limit and the transformation of human nature. This article considers Nietzsche’s main views on the need to reassess moral values during the devaluation of the Christian religion in Europe. The author analyses the concept of the will to power, which for Nietzsche is an internal energy, a necessary condition for the formation of new values. This is the essence of life. Through his idea of the overman, Nietzsche highlights the problem of cultural decadence in late 19thcentury Europe. In addition, the paper describes the views of W. Kaufmann, who called Nietzsche a philosopher-surgeon because he stressed the problem of moral degradation of European society. In Nietzsche’s philosophy, this ideological position is associated with the rejection of those values that he considered dead, as well as with an attempt to create new value orientations. The analysis of the image of Zarathustra allows us to conclude that the explication of the image of the overman reflects Nietzsche’s axiological ideal, which is based on a new understanding of human, established on the value orientations based on egocentrism, nihilism and the idea of will to power as the only condition for becoming. The author demonstrates that the underlying reason for the overman’s self-destruction is his belief that the world can exist without God. Idealizing the image of the overman is dangerous, as becoming an overman means overcoming human virtues, when, by crossing the boundaries of good and evil, the subject becomes able to create his/her own value orientations, which are incompatible with human virtues."

              "Looking for Luck in Farming: Intersubjective Relationships in the Mujarobat Manuscript\n\n: This study focuses on the intersubjective relationships contained in the Mujarobat text. This study comes from the still developing local beliefs and traditions of the coastal communities of North Java which are influenced by pre-Islamic beliefs and Islamic beliefs. Among the beliefs that still exist, it is the belief in predictions and calculations to get good luck and avoid bad luck. This study specifically aims to discuss how to grow plants on pages 40, 41, 42, 49, and 50 in the Mujarobat text. This study shows that the Mujarobat text contains local knowledge and intersubjective relationships between humans and humans as well as humans and non-humans — God and nature. Thus, using the paradigm of ancestral religions, this study argues that there is an intersubjective relationship between humans and non-humans that is responsible, ethical, and reciprocal when planting plants in the Mujarobat text which aim to get lucky.\n\n\nIntroduction\nAdherents of Islam in the north coast of Java, or also known as the pantura area (north coast of Java), are considered to have a strong and pure Islamic tradition compared to Islam in the palace area which is considered to still hold kejawen traditions-Javanese traditions in the pre-Islam (Koentjaraningrat, 2001;Rahmawati, Rais, & Wibowo, 2022).\nMeanwhile, another opinion says that the people of the north coast of Java still practice the Kejawen tradition and its rituals. Javanese coastal communities also believe in the existence of spirits. The spirits that are usually believed in in the traditions of these coastal communities include, for example: danyang or the spirit of the founder of the village, the spirits of the guardians, and the spirits of the ancestors who are considered to give good luck. As a result of this tradition still developing, coastal communities then carry out special rituals such as pilgrimages, annual Dedi Supriadi/Looking for Luck in Farming: Intersubjective Relationships in the Mujarobat Manuscript ceremonies, village cleaning, and nyadran and still believe in shamans as people who can help bring good luck and prevent bad luck (Mufid, 2006).\nAmong the kejawen traditions that are still developing among the people on the north coast of Java are those who still believe in and adhere to the calculations and predictions contained in primbon texts as guidelines for determining and carrying out daily activities or certain matters. One of the primbon texts used by the people of the north coast of Java as a reference for calculations, predictions, and rituals (prayers) influenced by Islamic values is the Mujarobat script (Abdullah & Ibroh, 2021).\nIn several previous philological studies, the Mujarobat text was used as a material object or as supporting data. Study on the Mujarobat text has been dissected in various approaches and perspectives. There are those who examine the Mujarobat manuscript in a sexological approach (Piah, 2014), ethnomedicine and traditional pharmacology (traditional medicine) (Rochmiatun, 2013;Susena, Pramono, & Hidayat, 2013;Zain, 2021), or make the mujarobat text only as supporting data (Gafur, 2007).\nFurthermore, the existence of the Mujarobat text can also be interpreted as a relationship between religious values and local beliefs and traditions. In relation to local beliefs, a number of scholars emphasize their perspectives on the relationship between religion and local beliefs in a sociopolitical context (Ruswanda & Maarif, 2021). For example, Geertz whose typology of Javanese society is abangan, santri, and priyayi (Geertz, 1960). Or, Ricklefs divided it into white and abangan groups (Ricklefs, 2019). Then, in the context between religion and custom, Picard does not see a separation between religion and custom in Indonesian traditional society (Picard, 2011).\nBased on the background above, the Is see a relationship between religious values and the content of local beliefs and traditions in the Mujarobat text. This study aims to explore to what extent the influence of pre-Islamic beliefs and traditions and Islamic beliefs itself developed and influenced the agrarian life of the north coast of Java. Therefore, in this paper, the I focuses his study on intersubjective relationships in the Mujarobat text, especially in how to grow plants using the paradigm of ancestral religions.\nThis study took the text of Mujarobat which had been edited and translated into Indonesian. The editing and translation process uses a philological approach. I examined the edited and translated Mujarobat texts qualitatively. This study uses a qualitative text content analysis method to read the text and explore the context related to the indigenous religions paradigm. Also, this method aims to understand the domination and hegemony of certain beliefs and traditions so as to influence the development of the beliefs and traditions of the people of the north coast of Java to this day.\n\nGeneral Description of the Mujarobat Manuscript: How to Plants in the Mujarobat Manuscript\nThe Mujarobat manuscript is a coastal script whose contents are similar to the primbon script. Its existence is still widely recognized by the people of the north coast of Java. In it, the Mujarobat manuscript discusses predictions, calculations, and prayers for certain events or activities with a blend of Islamic teachings and local (coastal) culture. According to Abdullah and Ibroh, the Mujarobat script is clear evidence of the mixing of culture in the pre-Islamic period with Islamic culture (Abdullah & Ibroh, 2021).\nIn this paper, the I will only use two Mujarobat manuscripts which have been edited and translated by Abdullah and Ibroh (see table 1). First, the Mujarobat manuscript which was found in Pesarean Village RT 01/RW 04, Pagerbarang District, Tegal Regency, Central Java. This first manuscript is a personal manuscript passed down from generation to generation by Mr. Sairun. He inherited the manuscript from his father, Kyai Rohman. This manuscript has changed ownership several times over a very long period of time. This first Mujarobat manuscript originally belonged to the Kyai Mad family, but because Kyai Mad often experienced illness. So, this Mujarobat manuscript was handed over to Kyai Rohman who is a community leader in Pesarean Village.\nThe condition of this first manuscript is still in good condition and the writing is legible. However, the exact age of this manuscript cannot be accurately ascertained. When viewed from the inheritance of manuscripts that have passed through several generations, this manuscript is estimated to be more than 50 years old and is included in the ancient manuscripts referring to Law Number 43 of 2007 concerning Libraries. This estimate is based on the age of Kyai Rohman who died at the age of around 104 years. To this day, this Mujarobat script is still used for various purposes, such as: the interest of farming, starting celebrations, building houses, good luck charms, and getting rid of bad luck (Abdullah & Ibroh, 2021).\nSecond, the Mujarobat manuscript which was found in Pesarean Village RT 01/RW 04, Pagerbarang District, Tegal Regency, Central Java. This manuscript belongs to Mr. Jaroni. The condition of this manuscript when it was found was not well maintained, holes were found on several pages, streaks of pen, and some pages were missing in page 126 and page 127. Apart from that, the contents of this script are random and without pattern.\nThis second manuscript was written using the Javanese letter Pegon. This second Mujarobat Manuscript can be broadly mapped into four sections which discuss: 1) the science of fiqh, 2) monotheism, 3) the science of interpretation and prediction of natural phenomena, dreams, physical conditions, and human psychology, 4) the science of pepetung or the science of following calculations neptu (Abdullah & Ibroh, 2021). Well preserved and legible Not well maintained, found holes in some pages and some pages are missing In general, the contents of the texts of the two Mujarobat manuscripts discuss Islamic teachings such as the teachings of faith (monotheism), Sharia, and prayers. The teachings of monotheism in the Mujarobat text only discuss the pillars of faith. Meanwhile, the Sharia teachings in the Mujarobat manuscript discuss the pillars of Islam which consist of: creed, prayer (explained in detail starting from the procedure for ablution to the procedure for sunnah prayer and its reading), zakat (fitrah and mal), fasting, and pilgrimage. Apart from that, this Mujarobat manuscript also discusses daily prayers such as prayers when going to bed and prayers when you wake up as well as certain (special) prayers such as the opening prayer for sustenance, the kanzul arsy prayer, and the nur buwat prayer.\nIn addition to general Islamic teachings, this Mujarobat text also discusses predictions based on neptu, days and markets to read one's character and fortune, the direction of sustenance and trade, building houses, farming, celebrations, predictions based on natural phenomena, and tattoos.\nIn the Mujarobat manuscript there are several pages that specifically discuss how to plant rice, like in page 40, page 41, page 42, page 49, and page 50. Pages 40, 41, and 42 discuss the year's behavior for people who will plant rice so that fertile. In it, it is explained: 1) the calculation of the year according to Aboge-Alif, Ha, early Jim, Za, Dal, Ba, Wawu, and late Jim; 2) the type of alms; 3) reading the prayer; and 4) the type of illness. Meanwhile, pages 49 and 50 describe the activities carried out when planting rice or secondary crops. Inside, it contains prayers both when planting rice or crops and prayers when planting or sowing seeds.\nThe following is the original text and translated into Indonesian on pages 40, 41, 42, 49 and 50 in the Mujarobat Manuscript (see table 2). This is what explains about yearly behavior for people who will plant crops so that what is planted grows well. Lamun tahun alif den kawiti dina jumat, ana dene sedekahe sega liwet, pecel gori doane arwah. larane bawang, gulung (nuli) den pendem ana ing tolake sawah.\nIf the Ha year begins on Wednesday, the first crops are planted in the northeast, the rice is liwet with egg dishes. salted fish and ginger sauce and meniran vegetables, recite the kasah prayer. The cure for the disease is horse dung, which is buried in the corner of the rice fields.\n\nLamun tahun Jim awal, maka kawitan dina jumat pernahe ana ing kidul wetan, lan (lamun) pungkasan ana ing kulon bener. Utawi sedekahe sega liwet lawuhe dadaran endog, doane selamet amane manuk serane godong kedalan lan godong kedaya, den tancepaken ana ing tolakane sawah.\nIf Jim's year is early then it starts on Friday in the southeast direction and if at the end of the year the meal starts from the west. The rice is liwet with a side dish of scrambled eggs. the prayer is safe. the pests are barung, the antidote is kedalan leaves and kedaya leaves are stuck in the corners of the rice fields.\nIf the year is Ba then it starts on Wednesday, every place is given Nasi Liwet with side dishes of fish and clubs and vegetables, pray for Qunut prayers. The pest is that the locust is the antidote to the oil being placed in the corner of the rice field and then it is burned. This is what it reads when putting: \"Tumenggung gunung aja mangan pari iki. panganen sekul sundul langit.\" Lamun tahun Wawu maka kawitana dina Kemis, arahe kidul wetan, wekasane tengah bener, sedekahe jajan pasar. lawuhane pecel gorih, serta dentaleni lawe wenang, serta jenang beras den pendem ana ing tolakane sawah, ikilah rajahe\n\n‫ه‬ ‫و‬ ‫لو‬ ‫ال‬ ‫ا‬ ‫ا‬ ‫و‬ ‫ح‬ ‫د‬ ‫ع‬ ‫ا‬ ‫م‬ ‫ا‬ ‫ط‬ ‫ال‬ ‫ا‬\nIf the year Wawu is the beginning then it starts on Thursday from the southeast, if at the end it starts from the middle, the alms of market snacks and jackfruit pecel are wrapped and tied with lawe threads along with rice jenang buried in the corner of the This is the action for people who are about to start planting rice in the fields or planting crops, this is the prayer that is read: \"Bismillahirrahanirahim allahuma salli 'ala muhammad wa ala ali muhammad asvhaduala illaha illallah wa asyhadu anna muhammadar Rasulullah, Kaki Antaboga Nini Antaboga who guards the earth, Feet Pure, Nini Murti who feeds the earth from the search for Teak skin of the earth, which gives fruit and appreciates the precious earth.\" Punika lamun arep nenadur utawa nyebar winih. Sarate iku kudu den catu nuli den lancepaken ing lemah pojokke lan landepa iku den adepaken ing pinggian, ikilah kang den waca: \"Sang Sri lumawa sang Dadung This is how it is if you want to plant or spread seeds. The conditions must be marked and stuck in the corner of the ground, and facing this edge it is read: \"Sang Sri lumawa sang Dadung,\" 50 alus, ajawuruk su digawa ing tetanduran ingsun lan dudu anggon ira ing kene, panggonan ira ing geni tugel loloh \"lamun nibaaken winih ngucap bismilahirrahmanirrahim, Sri, nitipaken ingsun ing wiji lan atulus kembang pentil uwoh.\" Don't give bad. Bring goodness to my plants.\nAnd here is not your place, your place is in the flames. While sowing the seeds say: \"bismilahirrahmanirrahim, Sri, I put the seed sincerely, it will flower and bear fruit.\"\n\nIntersubjective Relationships in the Mujarobat Manuscript\nThe practice of how to plant crops (especially rice or crops) contained in the Mujarobat Text can be categorized as religious experiences because it contains aspects of thought, practice, and fellowship. According to Wach, that the expression of religious experiences in the form of theoretical expressions (though) or thoughts includes belief systems, mythology, and dogmas; expression of religious experiences in the form of practical expressions including ritual worship systems and services; and the expression of religious experiences in the form of expressions of communion including the grouping and social interaction of religious people (Fatmawati, 2019;Irwansyah, Arifudin, & Yusran, 2018;Kahmad, 2009;Wach & Kitagawa, 1984).\nThe aspect of thinking in the Mujarobat text is the belief that when all the practices on how to plant rice contained in the Mujarobat text are carried out, the plant will grow well and thrive. Meanwhile, the aspect of practice (ritual) in the Mujarobat text is the entire process of practice when planting rice. Finally, the aspect of fellowship is the involvement of the community-which is even passed down between generations-in believing in their beliefs according to the Mujarobat text and manifesting them in the ritual practice.\nFurthermore, the method of planting plants that is found in the Mujarobat text can be classified as religious activity. This practice can be viewed as an intersubjective relationship with non-human entities using the ancestral paradigm. The paradigm of ancestral religions (indigenous religions paradigm) is an alternative way of looking at various religious practices. This point of view offers an offer to scholars who have been relatively certain using the world religions paradigm. The paradigm of ancestral religions seeks to accommodate groups of ancestral religions that have been excluded from world religious currents as well as non-religious groups of ancestral religions. Using the perspectives of ancestral religions, this paradigm tries to explain the relationship between humans and non-humans, whether it is the relationship with God, nature, stone forests and others.\nAccording to Cox, the paradigm of world religions refers to the study of religion under the classification that Western scholars commonly define as major world traditions (Cox, 2016). While Masuzawa views the term \"world religions\" as developing out of a nineteenth-century academic context, Tomoko Masuzawa argues that by creating a system for classifying the so-called major world religions, scholars intend \"to differentiate the West from the rest. \" Furthermore, he considers that the categorization has been carried out by making binary or tripartite divisions. The binary classification places religion into \"Eastern\" and \"Western\" categories (Masuzawa, 2005).\nBecause religion-everywhere-determines their beliefs in response to their mode of production and political organization, Platvoet argues that we can begin to construct a distinctive religious classification of the societies of which each is a part. As such, it can enable us to broaden our understanding of ancestral religions beyond just the elemental properties of locality, lineage, and orality. This is meant to include its more substantial features, which in turn can be contrasted with the fundamental content of transnational or world religions.\nAccording to Platvoet as cited by James, the main additional features of ancestral religions are as follows (Cox, 2016;Platvoet, 1993): a. Rituals are the core of the religious practices of ancestral religions; b. Beliefs within ancestral religions are not articulated, and therefore unclear and often contradictory; c. Followers of ancestral religions are recipients of \"continuous revelations\" through direct communication with spiritual beings obtained by various means such as dreams, visions, trance and spirit possession; d. The concept of salvation in ancestral religions is real and material, aimed at securing benefits in this world rather than in the afterlife.\nMeanwhile, world religions can be contrasted with ancestral religions. World religions share certain characteristics as follows (Cox, 2016;Platvoet, 1993): a.\nFollowers of world religions believe that their teachings provide the only path to salvation; b. The world's religions regard themselves as the recipients of final and complete revelation; c. Correct ways of believing define their primary concern, and adherents of the world's religions often disagree about the defining nature of orthodoxy; d. Salvation lies in another world or realm of experience that is quite distinguishable from this life.\nThe paradigm of world religions must be reviewed because of the problematic representation of indigenous peoples' religious practices. He not only misleadingly distinguishes and excludes the ancestral religions of world religions, but even falsifies them as religious. In many cases, the religious practices of indigenous peoples are even referred to as culture (cultural) in the sense of \"profane\" (Maarif, 2019).\nWhen compared in the world religion paradigm, the cosmological domain in the paradigm of ancestral religions is inhabited by beings, consisting of humans and non-humans (\"subjects\"), and the type of relationship between self and oneself is called \"anter-subjective\" (inter-subjective).\nIn terms of religiosity, \"intersubjective relations\" is the foundation. To be religious is to be involved in an intersubjective relationship. Once a person recognizes the personality of a being (human or non-human), he or she will commit to engaging with that being as a person. Intersubjective commitment brings responsibility, ethics, and reciprocity (Maarif, 2019).\nFirst, everyone in an intersubjective relationship bears the responsibility that determines what a person should do, and which aims to ensure the welfare of all involved in the intersubjective relationship. Being responsible is necessary in intersubjective relationships. Responsibility implies that \"what I do will affect me\". If a responsibility is not carried out properly, it will certainly affect one's own well-being (Maarif, 2019). Therefore, attitudes and behavior must always be adjusted to the responsibilities carried by oneself in the context of intersubjective relationships. For this sense, a spiritual view of religion is irrelevant. Religious life is a matter of responsibility between humans and other beings (subjects, persons) (Morrison, 2000).\nSecond, everyone is also bound by ethics (ethics). Ethics in this context implies that \"what I do will affect other people.\" Self-attitudes and behaviors must always be placed in a relational context with other self, so that self will consider appropriate attitudes and behaviors that contribute to the well-being of others. Self will be careful of attitudes and behavior that will damage the welfare of others, because in intersubjective relationships self-worth is determined by the welfare of others. If a person does good things, he will receive good things too. If not, it will also work (Maarif, 2019).\nThird, another commitment of intersubjective relationships is reciprocity, which implies \"what I give is what I take, or what I take is what I give.\" The self can only obtain something if it offers something, and when it offers something, it receives something--good or bad, theoretically--. The self may exist only through existence or in relation to another self. In intersubjective relationships, selfwell-being depends on the well-being of others. The self thus has to offer something that will contribute to the self-well-being of others, for only by doing so will the self develop its well-being. These three principles --responsibility, ethics, and reciprocity --in intersubjective relations are religious principles in the paradigm of indigenous religions. In other words, being religious means being responsible, ethical, and reciprocal. The type of relationship that ignores these principles is irreligious. A person who only cares about his own welfare and ignores others is an immoral person. He is selfish and very irresponsible, unethical and non-reciprocal (Maarif, 2019).\nSo, in short the Mujarobat text characterizes the religious practices of indigenous peoples not as \"subjects\", but \"subjects\". Self (human) perceives other people alive and dead (animate-inanimate) as a subject or person too. These subjects including humans and non-humans must be treated equally and correctly (Morrison, 2000).\nHumans (local people) realize and understand that apart from themselves, there are (nonhuman) creatures such as nature, mountains, soil, and so on that contribute to the environment in which they live, to their lives, their livelihoods, and their own well-being. The contribution is the personality of non-human beings. Humans are considered dependent on other forces, as other creatures depend on humans. Humans and non-humans are interdependent (Maarif, 2019).\nLearning from his experience, people who use local knowledge (indigenous knowledge) contained in the Mujarobat Manuscript can be perceived as establishing an intersubjective/personal relationship with the land, rice fields, springs, forests, mountains, weather, and all the elements that surround them with the principles religious principles of responsibility, ethics, and reciprocity. Local knowledge itself refers to the understanding, skills, and philosophies developed by local people with a long history and experience of interacting with their natural surroundings (Zhang & Nakagawa, 2018) Therefore, all aspects of knowledge and ritual contained in the Mujarobat text which contains guidelines on how to plant plants are part of an effort to involve nature as part of the religious aspect. The Mujarobat text describes the intersubjective relationship between humans (farmers) and nonhuman forces (rice fields, springs, soil, weather, mountains, and so on) as a relationship of responsibility, ethics, and reciprocity. Based on the paradigm of ancestral religions, those who respect and respect these non-human beings believe that these non-human beings have also done the same thing to them and to their lives.\nIn the Mujarobat text owned by Bapak Sairun and Bapak Jaroni in Pesarean village, Pagerbarang District, Tegal Regency, Central Java, especially page 40, page 41, page 42, page 49, and page 50. The contents of the text can be dissected in detail be as follows: a.\nIndigenous knowledge b. Human intersubjective relationship with non-human (God) c. Human intersubjective relationship with humans d. Human intersubjective relationship with non-human (nature) Local knowledge in the Mujarobat text which discusses how to plant plants so that they grow well is found in the Mujarobat text pages 40 to 42. These pages discuss local knowledge about behavior based on years according to calculations. According to Yaqin, Islam Aboge is synonymous with religious rituals related to numbers or the evening of the jawi (Yaqin, 2018). The calendar system in the Aboge Islamic calendar basically still refers to the Islamic calendar and the Javanese calendar. However, the Aboge calendar is arranged in a very distinctive and systematic manner, consisting of fixed and unchanging days, dates and years (Silvia, 2021).\nThe local knowledge contained in page 40 and page 41 of the Mujarobat text is eight sequences of years which each year has certain auspicious days for planting crops, giving alms, praying, and illness. The eight years are: Alif year, Ha year, early Jim year, Za year, Dal year, Ba year, Wawu year, and late Jim year. It is said in the text of Mujarobat: \"punika masalah arep ngaweruhi lakune tahun mungguh wong kang arep tetanduran, apa-apa barang kang den tandur supaya bagus.\" Meaning: This is the thing that explains about yearly behavior for people who will plant crops so that what is planted grows well.\nMeanwhile, pages 49 and 50 contain local knowledge that discusses prayers and conditions when planting rice or crops, or when sowing seeds. For example, in the text it is written: Punika lamun arep nenadur utawa nyebar winih. Sarate iku kudu den catu nuli den tancepaken ing lemah pojokke lan landepa iku den adepaken ing pinggian, ikilah kang den waca: \"Sang Sri lumawa sang Dadung alus, aja wuruk su digawa ing tetanduran ingsun lan dudu anggon ira ing kene, panggonan ira ing geni tugel loloh\" lamun nibaakenwinih ngucap bismilāhirrahmānirrahīm, Sri, nitipaken ingsun ing wiji dan atulus kembang pentil uwoh.\" Meaning: This is how it is if you want to plant or sow seeds. The conditions must be marked and stuck in the corner of the ground, and facing this edge it is read: \"Sang Sri lumawa sang Dadung alus, Don't give bad things. Bring goodness to my plants. And here is not your place, your place is in the flames. At the time of sowing the seeds say: \"bismilāhirrahmānirrahīm, Sri, I sincerely deposit the seeds, they will flower and bear fruit\" (Al-Kabir, n.d.) The intersubjective relationships in the Mujarobat text page 40, page 41, page 42, page 49, and page 50 are relationships of responsibility, ethics, and reciprocity originating from local knowledge of the community. The three entities are interdependent, for example: Lamun taun Ha maka kawitan ing dina rebo, olehe ngawiti tandur pojok lor wetan, ana dene sedekahe iku sega liwet lawuhe endog lan gereh kelata, lan sambel jahe lan jangan meniran lan doane kasah. Larane sundak, tambane teletong jaran den pendem ana ing tolakane sawah. This means: If the year Ha begins on Wednesday, the first crops are planted in the northeast, rice liwet with side dishes of eggs, salted fish and ginger sauce and vegetable meniran, read the Kasah prayer. The cure for the disease is horse dung buried in the corner of the rice field (Al-Kabir, n.d.) In this text, we can analyze it as follows, kamlimat, if the year Ha begins, then kawitan ing dina rebo, bye ngawiti tandur corner lor wetan (if the year Ha begins on Wednesday, the first plants are planted in the northeast) is local knowledge which forms the basis of the calculation process. in the Mujarobat manuscript. Then, sentences: sedekahe iku sega liwet lawuhe endog lan gereh kelata, lan sambel jahe lan jangan meniran (his alms liwet rice with egg dishes, salted fish and ginger sauce and vegetable meniran) shows aspects of the intersubjective relationship between humans and humans. Meanwhile, the inter-subjective relationship between humans and God is reflected in the sentence: lan duane kasha (recite the kasah prayer). Finally, the sentence: larane sundak, tambane teletong jaran den pendem ana ing tolakane sawah (the disease sundak is treated by horse dung buried in the corner of the rice fields) is an example of the intersubjective relationship between humans and nature, which is the process of getting good luck and keeping away from bad luck (crop failure). When the process of planting rice involves nature in it. Other evidence is also found on pages 49-50, which writes: Punika lamun arep nenadur utawa nyebar winih. Sarate iku kudu den catu nuli den tancepaken ing lemah pojokke lan landepa iku den adepaken ing pinggian, ikilah kang den waca: \"Sang Sri lumawa sang Dadung alus, aja wuruk su digawa ing tetanduran ingsun lan dudu anggon ira ing kene, panggonan ira ing geni tugel loloh\" lamun nibaakenwinih ngucap bismilāhirrahmānirrahīm, Sri, nitipaken ingsun ing wiji dan atulus kembang pentil uwoh.\" Meaning: This is how it is if you want to plant or sow seeds. The conditions must be marked and stuck in the corner of the ground, and facing this edge it is read: \"Sang Sri lumawa sang Dadung alus, Don't give bad things. Bring goodness to my plants. And here is not your place, your place is in the flames. At the time of sowing the seeds say: \"bismilāhirrahmānirrahīm, Sri, I sincerely deposit the seeds, they will flower and bear fruit\" (Al-Kabir, n.d.) The text contains an intersubjective relationship between humans and non-humans-God and nature-who are involved in it. Sentence: punika lamun arep nenadur utawa nyebar winih. Sarate iku kudu den catu nuli den tancepaken ing lemah pojokke lan landepa iku den adepaken ing pinggian (this is how it is if you want to plant or sow seeds. The conditions must be marked and stuck in the corner of the soil, and faced to the edge) contains aspects of responsibility, ethics, and reciprocity between humans and nature. Meanwhile, sentences: ikilah kang den waca: \"Sang Sri lumawa sang Dadung alus, aja wuruk su digawa ing tetanduran ingsun lan dudu anggon ira ing kene, panggonan ira ing geni tugel loloh\" lamun nibaakenwinih ngucap bismilāhirrahmānirrahīm, Sri, nitipaken ingsun ing wiji dan atulus kembang pentil uwoh\" (this is what it read: \"Sang Sri lumawa sang Dadung alus, Don't give bad. Bring goodness to my plants. And here is not your place, your place is in the flames. When sowing the seeds, say: \"bismilāhirrahmānirrahīm, Sri, I will sincerely place the seeds, they will flower and bear fruit\" are aspects of responsibility, ethics, and reciprocity between man and God.\n\nConclusion\nHow to grow plants written in the Mujarobat manuscript page 40, page 41, page 42, page 49, and page 50 contain intersubjective relationships in them according to the perspective of ancestral religions. The Mujarobat manuscript found by Bapak Sairun and Bapak Jaroni is evidence of a meeting between the influence of pre-Islamic beliefs and culture and the influence of Islam on the north coast of Java.

The digital-based religious literacy sources referred to in this study are religious sources and networks of religious resources commonly accessed by students to increase religious insight and knowledge. This study uses a descriptive quantitative approach with survey-research data collection by questionnaire, using google form. Document data or questionnaires are analyzed for their content to conclude reflectively. The results showed 1) the enthusiasm of students in finding sources of digital-based religious literacy was tremendous, students tended to seek religious information of their choice through the Internet and social media they had, including surfing on Google, Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, WhatsApp, Tiktok, and religious websites. 2) religious literacy is chosen by students seeking religious insight through the preacher who is active in cyberspace because they consider listening to lectures via the Internet to be practical, easy to obtain, and easy to understand the contents of the lectures. 3) the platforms or websites they visit tend to be mainstream lecturers. Therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to the rectorate and the Ministry of Religion to explore the contents accessed by students to create religious moderation among students.\n\nIntroduction\nunderstanding and practicing religious teachings so that religion can function and act as a moral and ethical foundation in development, (2) Increasing religious harmony, and (3) Improving religious life services.\nThe content of the Islamic religious theme in this spiritual reading can refer to the Decree of the Minister of Religious Affairs Number 110 of 1982, which can also be adapted to developments that include the Qur'an and al-Hadit s, Islamic law and social institutions, proselytizing and communication, the history of Islamic civilization, Arabic language and literature / general literature, Islamic thought, modern developments in Islam, science and technology. The field of Islamic studies is even more systematic, as proposed by Nasution (2001: 28-29), namely: 1. Basic Islamic teachings, including the science of the Quran, Tafsir, Hadith, and modern development/renewals in this field; 2. The fundamental thought of Islam includes Kalam science, Philosophy, Tasawuf and Tarekat, Religion Comparison, and modern developments/renewals in this field; 3. Social institutions, including Ushul Fiqh, Mu'amalah Fiqh, Siyasah Fiqh (politics), Worship Fiqh, Economy Fiqh, Military Fiqh, and other social institutions and modern development/updates in this field; 4. Islamic history and civilization and modern developments in it; 5. Islamic language and literature and contemporary products in it; 6. Islamic education and recent developments in it; 7. Islamic proselytizing and modern developments in it.\nReligious literacy, according to Moore (2006) in his article \"Overcoming Religious Literacy: a Cultural Studies Approach,\" is the ability to see and analyze the intersection between religion and social, political, and cultural life from diverse points of view. Furthermore, Dinham & H Jones (2010), in their book \"Religious Literacy Leadership in Higher Education: An Analysis of Challenges of Religious Faith, and Resources for Meeting Them for University Leader,\" Religious Literacy is essential to counteract stereotypes and build good relationships on top of existing differences (Haq et al., 2022).\nGood religious literacy skills will support students to be able to think and have a moderate perspective so that there is no concern, as the results of a survey conducted by the Alvara Research Center in June 2018 and the Center for the Study of Islam and Society (PPIM).\nA survey by Alvara showed that students were strongly indicated to be exposed to intolerant teachings and radicalism supported by religious fanaticism. The declaration of caliphate support by students of the Bogor Agricultural Institute (IPB) in January 2017 became clear evidence of the inclusion of radicalism among students.\nThis condition is in line with the opinion of Maulana (2017), stating that the teachings of intolerance and radicalism have entered regular schools through religious teachers who spread the idea of exclusivism to their students. In addition, radicalism is suspected of having entered massively Islamic educational institutions such as madrasahs and Islamic boarding schools (Zada, 2009). Zada concluded that several factors caused the emergence of the radicalization process of Indonesian Muslims, including a very rigid literal attitude in understanding religious texts that must be following or the same as the conditions in the time of the Prophet Muhammad P.B.U.H.\nBased on the elaboration of the meaning of literacy above, it can be understood that literacy is not only limited to the ability to read and write but also to understand what is read and written. Such as the definition proposed by Moore (2006) in his study of religious literacy in several countries, including Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and the United States, found that the quality of diversity literacy affects the religious behavior of its adherents. Moore defined \"religious literacy\" as an ability to understand spiritual teachings not only in normative doctrines but also in how religion is applied in a social context (Jahroni & Abu Bakar, 2019), a problem of religious literacy in the form of the ability to understand spiritual teachings obtained through religious learning. The ability to understand religious education in the context of its implementation was found through learning about religion.\nIn line with the explanation above, Prothero (2007) defined religious literacy as a person's ability to understand and use religious traditions in the form of key terms, symbols, doctrines, praxis, speech, character, and narratives in everyday life.\nThe exact definition was also put forward by al-Syami (2018) in his book \"Fiqh al-Din wa al-Tadayyun.\" Al-Syami distinguished these two categories, namely \"Fiqh al-Din,\" which referred to the ability to understand the ideal doctrine of religion written in the scriptures. Meanwhile, \"Fiqh al-Tadayyun\" was able to know how the perfect principle of faith was applied and practiced in a changing socio-historical context.\nIn an era of disruption, millennials have thus accessed religious resources via the Internet and social media. As a result, they quickly consume radical and extreme religious content without consulting with experts around them, namely religious lecturers. Thus, the concept of digital-based literacy sources to increase religious moderation among students proposed in this study is limited to digital-based literacy sources that they use in understanding the teachings of the Islamic religion and seeing how they practice what they know from digital-based religious sources by assessing the students' religious moderation attitudes.\nRegarding the sources of religious literacy students obtain to deepen their spiritual knowledge, this research's context is limited to digital-based media. Digital-based media is audio-visual media as information that can be heard and seen, such as directly following studies or watching television and radio. Digital media in this study is a source of knowledge that contains religious information on the Internet accessed through devices, such as YouTube, Instagram, Line, Website, Facebook, WhatsApp, Tiktok, and others.\nThe 21st century is one of the growing media genres. It differs from a few centuries before, like nine saints, the wali songo era, or afterward (Mukhlis, 2020). Online media is also called digital media, or media presented online on the Internet, or in Indonesian, is often referred to as \"daring\" media. In the online Indonesian dictionary, it is an acronym for \"Dalam jaringan\" (online). So, \"online\" media means \"online\" on the Internet.\nOnline media generally refers to the type or format of media that can only be accessed through the Internet through text, photos, videos, and sound. Thus, all platforms in online media such as Email, Mailing Lists, websites including news portals, Blogspot, WhatsApp, online TV, and online radio are included in the scope of understanding online media. In addition, games, chats, quizzes, and others are also included in the sense of online media. While specifically in a more specific context, online media refers to the definition of mass media with particular characteristics that present journalistic works (both news, articles, and features) online (online journalism-cyber journalism). Or in other words, online media is mass media given online on websites related to journalistic works. The presence of the Internet with its online media makes quite a revolutionary change both in terms of the way it is mediated and in the context of the social life of its users. People no longer have to look for the media and sit sweetly somewhere to see and listen to something that the media presents. Nowadays, the media is becoming an inherent part of everyone's life. The media always accompanies wherever a person is.\nMeanwhile, in the context of social life, many writings presented, both positively and negatively, related to the impact of online communication media, especially on social life. Related to content in online media that is quite attention-grabbing, along with various events that lead to intolerance in people's lives, is the problem of radical content that gives birth to radicalism in society. Radical and radicalism are two terms often associated with acts of violence connoted by faith-based violence, including acts of terrorism.\nOnline media is a very strategic medium for seeding radical ideas. Online media has long been used as a means of indoctrination and recruitment of jihadists. Websites are the most widely used online media platforms. Jeremy White (2012) (5) Propaganda. With the development of platforms in online media, the means of spreading radical ideas have become increasingly diverse. Literacy skills are essential in counteracting negative understanding of radical content in online media. Potter stated: \"Mass media has the potential to have many negative effects on individuals; Media literacy is needed to help people protect themselves from potentially negative effects.\" Literacy skills will increase understanding of media content and strengthen individual control over media. Understanding and control over media content is the ability to identify and distinguish between fact or fictional information and the ability to identify and distinguish websites from reliable sources and irresponsible websites. At least in line with the definition of media literacy as put forward by Aufderheide & Firestone,\" literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate and communicate messages in a variety of forms\" (Hobbs & Frost, 2003) which needs to be added related to this element of the definition of media literacy is the understanding of the source and impact of the message. Silverblatt identified five aspects of media literacy; a simulation reality formed based on the interests of values, ideologies, and economic, political, social, and cultural contexts. It is in this context that media literacy is indispensable.\nThe focus of religious literacy sources studied in this study is the source of spiritual information obtained by students from various digital-based media, such as Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, and other religious websites managed privately or organizationally. After knowing the source of religious literacy used by students, observe the attitudes and aspects of religious moderation from the start of religious literacy.\nStudying religious literacy among students is essential to realize moderate students. Efforts to strengthen religious moderation are carried out systematically and continuously, at least through 3 strategies, namely: a) socialization and dissemination of the idea of religious moderation; (b) institutionalization of religious moderation into binding programs and policies; (c) integrating the perspective of religious moderation into the 2020-2024 National Term Development Plan (RPJMN). In addition, the bill is part of supporting the Ministry of Religious Affairs' 2015-2019 national plan and strategy, namely: 1) Improving the quality of understanding and practice of religious teachings so that religion can function and act as a moral and ethical foundation in development; (2) Increase religious harmony; (3) Improving the ministry of spiritual life.\n\nResearch Methods\nThis research was a descriptive quantitative study (Cresswell, 2015). In the beginning, the researchers collected data by asking several questions to students related to the digital sources of religious literacy that they visit, as an instrument containing seven questions to get information about sites or webs, as well as social media that student access, then analyzed and then classified first. After organizing, the researcher continued the qualitative step by conducting in-depth interviews and document analysis. The data validation in this study used credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability tests.\nThe population in this study was students of private colleges in Bekasi. The samples in this study used simple random sampling by randomly selecting sample members. Individuals selected randomly filled out a questionnaire so that the samples obtained could represent the existing population and describe the people in Bekasi City.\nThe sample in this study was 102 students from private colleges in Bekasi. To determine who the students would sample, researchers used random sampling techniques, where all students had the same right to be selected. The random process was carried out from the population on each campus. Selected respondents filled out a questionnaire to provide data on digital-based literacy sources and analyzed the values of religious moderation from the content they accessed.\nThe characteristics of the respondents were as follows; (1) Students from all semesters because they wanted to get a general idea, (2) were willing to participate in research. This study used several data collection techniques, including: 1) Instruments: Questions about the sources of religious information students access and analysis results of the moderation values of the content they access; 2) Interview: in-depth interviews with several academics to explore the study of literacy resources.\nData analysis was carried out based on materials from the field in the form of open interviews and literature studies. In addition, content analysis was used to analyze the content of digital-based student religious literacy sources to find sources of spiritual information, such as websites, Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, Tiktok, WhatsApp, and analysis results of the values of the content they access. While the study of the interviews carried out was to analyze the characteristics, tendencies, direction, and ideology or thoughts conveyed by the speakers and the content they visited.\nQualitative data analysis techniques obtained from the interview results were analyzed using the following stages.\n1) Reading or studying the data, marking keywords and ideas in the data.\n2) Learning the keywords and trying to find themes that come from the data.\n3) Thinking by making categories (keywords) derived from meaningful data, searching and finding patterns, relationships, and causing general findings. Data analysis of this study used descriptive-exploratory analysis. In addition, document data or questionnaires were analyzed for their content to conclude reflectively. This research showed the understanding, sources of information, and religious literacy networks that were used as sources of spiritual knowledge for students of private colleges in Bekasi, starting from frequently visited platforms, websites, and social media that are accessed and Kiai and ulama who were loved by students of the private college in Bekasi City.\n\nResults and Discussions\nIn this study, researchers took samples to fill out a questionnaire of digital-based religious literacy sources focused only on private college students. The respondents in this study were 102 students from the general department of 20 private colleges in Bekasi. They were graduates of available and religion majors.\nViewed from the table above, several students who responded to the digital-based religious literacy source survey questionnaire consisted from the Bina Insani University campus, Stikom Interstudy, Bhayangkara University, Trisakti, and others. Although they were from a standard (non-Islamic) private campuses, their enthusiasm for studying and searching for religious sources was very high. Some of the study programs that responded to the questionnaire consisted of accounting, management, communication science, primary teacher education, Psychology, Informatics engineering, mathematics education, and nursing science. Students who responded to the questionnaire also consisted of those from various semesters so they could fully describe the sources of literacy accessed by students. What was interesting in this study was that researchers tried to see how often students access digitalbased religious information. The following was an overview presented in the image below; Table 1\n\n. Frequency of student in accesing religious information\nFrom the results of the research we got from the questionnaire that was responded to by students, it turned out that many students were still not interested in exploring religious information. As seen from the picture below, 34.3% of students accessed spiritual information \"only if you are free,\" and as many as 16.7% of students accessed religious information only \"if you need it.\" When accumulated, we would get a total of 51% of the respondents having low interest in accessing spiritual information. It was a big question, why was their interest so common, considering that they were individuals who spent more time in cyberspace?\nOnly 36.3% of the total respondents appeared to have a high enough interest in accessing religious information, with 16.7% multiple times a day, 10.8% once a day, and 8.8% once a week. The rest only access spiritual information just once a month or if they get an assignment for religion courses. Furthermore, researchers also wanted to know what platforms were accessed by students presented in the table below; Table 2. Reference platform to find religious information Platforms commonly visited by students to find religious information were dominated by Google (articles or blogs) at 70.6%, Youtube at 58.8%, Instagram at 62.7%, Tiktok 39.2%, WhatsApp at 18.6%, Institution religious website at 13.7%, Twitter 12.7 %, Facebook 4.9%, and Telegram 3.9%.\nThe information above shows that students preferred to find religious information through digital platforms instead of asking teachers, lecturers, friends, and even printed books. This fact should be a concern for policymakers to determine the policy direction in controlling and providing a digital platform for students to access religious information that will lead them to understand radicalism.\nAs observed from the table above, students tended to look for religious information that was very familiar and easily accessible with their smartphones. Youtube and Instagram were the most accessed by students looking for spiritual knowledge. What was very interesting was that Tiktok, which just recently appeared, was also able to become a means of conveying religious material, not just a place to show off to dance and have fun. This proved that any media had positive and negative values, depending on the user's policy.\nThis also needs to be discussed and input from stakeholders to train ulama from among the young dai to be familiar with social media platforms, such as Youtube, Instagram, and others, to meet the needs of students accessing religious knowledge. Researchers were trying to dig deeper for student access in exploring religious sources as presented in the following table; Table 3\n\n. Percentage of Inspirational Preachers\nFrom the table above, the religious figure who was popular among students was Ustadz Hanan Attaki; apart from the fact that UHA was active on social media, what made him accepted by students was that he had color and characteristics in his proselytizing, materials about hijra, taubat, muhasabah, and love which were supported by musical murottal abilities to make his Youtube and Instagram content widely accessed by students. This was following what was expressed by M. Fadlan Pratama student in semester six, positing that \"To support religious literacy among students, it should also be supported by the ability of lecturers to deliver interesting material, the availability of religious books from various references and updated journals so that it will further open students' insights.\" Ustadz Hanan Attaki is increasingly known to the public because the way he preaches on social media can build public perception, especially the millennial generation, in a simple way. His distinctive rhetoric, language style, voice, and gestures support this. The dress style is casual to compensate for the audience, which young people dominate. Contemporary, but still syar'i, that is him. (Abdullah, 2018) One thing that is the most crucial point in UHA's da'wah is the use of language that is simple and easy for young people to accept, making it a role model in contemporary Islam, where the target of da'wah is precisely young people. Also, the preaching method has fulfilled the three methods in Surah An-Nahl verse 125: the Al-Hikmah method, Al-Mauidzatu-l Hasanah, and Wa-Jadilhum Bi Al-Lati Hiya Ahsan (Parhan et al., 2020). Next, he focused on hijrah, a message of Islamic da'wa that not only tells about individual repentance but also as a current trend that young Muslims must follow (Muthohirin, 2021).\nThis was still very lacking from the results of interviews conducted with students. So, the student said that he and his other friends were more interested in the Internet. With the Internet, all things were very accessible. Students were also more interested in seeking religious insights by looking for online speakers that matched their interests. It is because the delivery of material by online ustadz was easier to understand. Among the ustadz loved by the students were; Ustadz Abdul Somad, Ustadz Adi Hidayat, and Ustadz Hanan Attaki.\nOne of the reasons why Ustadz Abdul Somad's preaching was widely accepted and followed by thousands of followers in his preaching, such as; the use of verbal humor can easily be found if the da'wah is not a comedy-producing event. Instead, preachers use verbal humor for one purpose, conveying teachings, advice, or even criticism, most acceptably and entertainingly (Afdhal & Hamzah, 2019).\nApart from humorous sermons, one of the successes of UAS lies in its ability to persuade its audience to record and post them on the Internet, especially on the video-sharing platform YouTube.com. Abdul Somad even claims to be a preacher for millions of viewers. However, most of his sermons are uploaded to the Internet by his listeners. Abdul Somad does not rely on a team of professionals to structure his speeches and post them online. This strategy of enabling its audience to create and share user-generated content has proven successful. Abdul Somad was able to secure millions of online viewers, and this helped him increase the proliferation of his sermons relatively inexpensively (Ridho, 2019).\nUstadz Adi Hidayat has a different character. He applied the principle of qaulan sadida communication based on four signs: correct words, firm words, honest words, and not complicated (Nazar & Qoulan Sadida, 2022). Ustadz Adi Hidayat's preaching models are like teaching, making it easier for listeners to have a picture of education after developing the material. Besides that, Ustadz Adi Hidayat often studies legal or fiqh issues, making the excuse that the material presented can be memorized, applied, and even developed as a new teaching medium (Cahyono, 2019).\nFurthermore, the reasons why students prefer to listen to online lectures as a source of religious literacy are as follows; Table 4. The reason for listening to the preachers As many as 74.5% of respondents, when asked why preferred listening to online lectures because they found it easy to understand. This shows that their generation was the instant generation. They liked something straight to the point in online media, and they could instantly get what information they needed without being pedantic. In addition, they were also happy with the speaker whose lecture content was funny and did not contain elements of insults or verbal violence. Furthermore, the researchers tried to survey information from students on the range of proselytizing accounts and what websites were more dominantly visited by students to find out the level of moderation of their diversity. The results of the survey are as in the following table; Based on the table above, it can be concluded that students accessed many sites. Many students also accessed religious information without naming the content specifically, just by mentioning YouTube and Instagram. When viewed from the table above, the content that students often accessed was Pemuda Hijrah 26.5%, Rodja TV 18.6%, Lampu Islam 18.6%, Nabawi 14.7%, Shift Media 9.8%, NU Online 9.8%, Ammar Channel 8.8%, Streaming Majlis Rasullah 7.8%, and others as illustrated in the table above. So, various sites and websites were visited by students.\nThe most crucial reason why the Pemuda Hijrah Channel is so popular with young people is that this YouTube account has compatibility and benefits listeners. The advantage gained is getting benefits, namely increasing religious knowledge and getting the values of life, having a positive impact, namely da'wah videos on the Shift Media YouTube account reminding and inviting to be even better, motivating, namely the Hijrah Youth Movement Community to be inspired to become a good person. Better from time to time, as well as exciting and suitable YouTube content for young people (Ananda, 2021).\nUnlike before, Rodja TV has adopted a safe discourse by showing its inclination toward mainstream Sunni Islam rather than a jihadi approach to politics fighting for establishing an Islamic state. Rodja TV's main target is localism and globalism, but it is open to local values and selected expressions of modernism (Sanjaya et al., 2022) (Muthohirin et al., 2022a). As for the station initially targeting a limited audience, because it broadcasted information about Islamic teachings, its public audience expanded, and members of Muslim associations, business people, and government members became interested in Rodja TV's programs (Bakti, 2018). Nevertheless, in the end, this channel is liked and in demand by youth because of its straightforward delivery and several other factors.\nObserving the various channels visited by students illustrated how familiar they were with religious media and the content they quickly accessed. Seeing conditions like this needed special attention from stakeholders to monitor how the range of the material presented in the content was introduced so that they could control the younger generation in Indonesia from intolerant understandings and radicalism among students to increase knowledge of religious moderation following the policies of the Ministry of Religion.\n\nConclusions\nBased on the explanation above, it could be concluded that students' understanding of religious literacy came from sites accessed online. However, the digital-based sites, websites, and media students accessed at fifteen private colleges were diverse. It could be seen from the variety of speakers, social media, Internet, and religious sites to add insight or support course assignments and meet spiritual knowledge needs.\nNext, improving the understanding of students' religious literacy was undoubtedly very important, but the supervision of material from sites accessed by students to avoid intolerant information and elements of radicalism among research students suggests that; first, the rectorate should make a policy that emphasizes that students avoid religious sites that contain details of radicalism and intolerance, of course, under the guidance and supervision of lecturers who teach spiritual classes. Second, the Faculty should make a policy that requires students to be active in the activities of religious organizations to gain more moderate religious insights to create religious moderation among students. Moreover, it can be seen from the sources of study and preachers that students choose to consume digital literacy. The students' favorites are successively from various platforms, including Google, Instagram, and YouTube. However, this platform is still vulnerable to immoderate notions, and it is supported by the frequency of internet access, which most students can repeatedly access in a day.\nIn addition, the selection of da'wah figures also influences how students think. Several preachers are chosen in a less significant number of the selected da'wah interpreters with a salafi paradigm. This condition tends to make students not believe and have a moderate personality. A fact was revealed that the student's popular choice was the preacher with the most straightforward language to understand. Do not use language that is difficult to comprehend-followed by the content category of da'wah, which contains humorous elements, and da'wah, spiced with the art of humor.\nUltimately, this is not easy for Islamic educational institutions to provide a da'wah platform according to the criteria that are liked and liked by students, who incidentally are young people. So those students are not wrong in choosing media as learning material that will later be applied in everyday life. Nevertheless, more profoundly, this is also aimed at saving the next generation from a series of infiltration of radicalism, extremism as well as liberalism, and secularism."

              "The Apathy of students towards the study of Islamic studies in Nigerian Higher Institutions (Tai Solarin University of Education\n\n: This study investigates factors responsible for apathy or lack of interest in the study of Islamic Studies Education as a course in Tai Solarin University of Education, Ijagun,Ijebuode, Ogun State of Nigeria. It is believed generally that some students show lack of interest in some courses at the under graduate level and this eventually interferes with enrolment or population of students that study the course or affect their performance if they eventually enroll for the course. This study therefore investigates the factors responsible for the apathy of students towards Islamic studies and equally proffer solution to the identified problems. In carrying out this research the descriptive approach was used. The research instrument used are the Pearson correlation coefficient and simple percentages. A more positive correlation coefficient (closer to 1) reveals the validity and reliability of the instrument This study unfolds that Inferiority complex, parental influence and poor back ground in Islamic Studies are major factors responsible for the low enrolment of students in Islamic Education Department of Tai Solarin University of Education. It was therefore recommended that good remuneration of teachers, parental support, provision of Arabic remedial class and educating the masses on the relevance of Islamic studies will go a long way to increase the turnout of students who study Islamic Studies in the University.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY\nIslamic Education is as old as the religion of Islam in Nigeria. The discipline appeals to the spiritual need of man through the training of the spirit and the body. In appreciating man\"s relationship with the fellow man and Allah, Islam as a religion and way of life emphasizes on seeking of knowledge especially the one that deals with spiritual aspect of man. This is mentioned by Allah in the Glorious Qur\"an\"; those truly fear Allah, among His servants are those who have knowledge (Q35:28). In the light of this, the Prophet (SAW) is reported to have; said \"seek knowledge from cradle to grave\". Also, in another tradition, he says; \"He whom Allah wishes well for, He endows him with the knowledge of the religion\". It is worth to note that the aim of including religion and moral studies in the curriculum of school is to produce citizens that will be of benefit, to the society ( Salisu, .,2002).\nThe mandatory statement of the National Policy on Education on the teaching of religious and moral instruction in schools is reinforced by the deterioration of social values since early 1970 it, is believed that there could really be no education worth of the same without religion. It is religion that gives meaning to life. (Salisu, 2002) This attests to the fact that any curriculum which fails to give adequate attention to Religious and moral studies will not achieve its aim and objectives. Though other subjects might be taught thoroughly as we are witnessing today in the Nigerian Educational System.\nIn recent years it has been noticed that there are insufficient Islamic teachers in both secondary and Primary Schools compared to other schools subject including Christian Religious Studies. This view was expressed by Saaba (2002). This has led to the relegation of the subject to be taught at the hour in which the students would have been tired. This has been a great concern to Muslim parents Muslim in educational sector and concerned Islamic organizations. It is believed that teaching Islamic studies in schools will go a long way in uplifting the moral standard and religious understanding of the Muslim students in future.\nBefore the advent of the colonial Master or Europeans, most Muslim parents enrolled their children in the western oriented schools, though, it was Christian Religious Studies that was being taught in these schools but when the Muslim parent protested in 1916. Then, most of those who taught Islamic studies were mostly mallams drawn from Arabic and Islamic Schools who have not undergone any formal training in teaching. Still the manpower needed to teach this subject was not enough as population of Islamic Studies teachers to Muslim students was low. To worsen the situation, the Federal Government and Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) introduced the minimum qualification for teaching in schools to be The Nigeria Certificate in Education (N.C.E). This automatically disqualify and displace the local mallams from teaching Islamic Studies in schools. Though Islamic studies like any other course is being offered at both colleges of Education and Universities even with low-cut-off mark for easy admission. It was realized that most students do not put in for the course and even those admitted for the course most of them always turn down the admission and even prefer to stay at home rather than studying the course. Uthman (2002) observes that this had invariably affected the number of those that study the course and subsequently the population of Islamic studies teachers in schools. This has led to pathetic situation which include employing some non-Muslims to teach Arabic and Islamic studies. It is a known fact that a person who does not cherish and believe in Islam cannot teach Islamic studies correctly and without prejudice. Those teachers might be non-Muslims who have studied Religious studies or have idea of the course. What we expect of this is nothing but indoctrination of Muslim students who have been denied of their religious and educational right of learning and understanding their religion as contained in the constitution of Nigeria of 1999. It is unfortunate that in many schools where there are no Islamic studies teachers the Muslim students do not have any option but to attend or force to join Christian Religious Studies class. Even, where there are Islamic studies teachers, the workload is always too much. Though, we Muslim have been crying of educational marginalization but it is saddening that we are the architects of this ugly scenario. Hence, this prompted the research into the topic \"Apathy of students towards the study of Islamic studies in Higher Institution: Tai Solarin University of Education as a case study\". The topic shall examine and reveal the remote and immediate causes of this problem, its impacts on the Muslims in Nigeria .and lastly the proffered solutions to this problem. This will afford the Muslim community the opportunity of finding its place in the society and contribute her meaningful quota to the development of the society.\nSTATEMENT OF PROBLEM The major problem which this research work will look into are:-(1) What are the causes for the low enrollment of students in Islamic Studies in Higher Institution? (2) What is being responsible for the relegation of Islamic Studies? (3) What has been responsible for the negative attitudes of students toward Islamic studies?

This has drawn the attention of many Muslim especially those in educational sector. To this, there have been number of articles on the causes of the problem militating against the effective teaching of Islamic\" studies in secondary schools. But much has been directed to the apathy which students have for Islamic studies in Higher Institution so, this work is hope to fill the gap on apathy towards Islamic studies in Higher Institution. Literature will be reviewed on the following sub-themes:-1.  Fafunwa (1980) observed that one of the major problem facing Nigeria as a nation on the part of the average citizens are of the three elements in the various cycle of ignorance, poverty and disease, the most deadly is ignorance which can only be eradicated when majority of the people become enlightened. It is in pursuance of this noble objective that the government of Nigeria adopted education as an instrument per excellence for effective national development. Education is an inevitable concept in the life of a man. It is what gives meaning to life. Education equips individual with the tool of knowledge for facing the challenges of life and surmounting it. Dele Giwa et al (2003) asserts that education assists man in comprehending the society. It makes individual to be useful to himself and the society at large. Education may be in form of involvement in any purposeful human activities that are aimed at providing learning experience, education helps people to see positive things with society and as well being able to influence environment and contribute their meaningful quota to the society. Dele Giwa et al (2003) sees education as the process of socialization. Socialization comprises the culture indoctrination, dressing, school, region etc. they all come together to make up education. Education covers all aspects training and imitation into the life of the society. There is no univocal definition of education, but we shall examine some definitions.\nAccording to Ayeni and Ajiboye (1999) education is seen as an organized and systematic step by step process of learning by which a student upon the successful completion of one level may progress to the next under the direction of a qualified teaching personnel and at which in the end the student receives some from of recongnition e.g certificate or degree or diploma\" Good (1959) defined education as the aggregate of all processes by means of which a person develops abilities, attributes and other forms of positive value in the society in which he or she lives. It therefore refers to a transformation process during which the future of any society is shaped through instruction of citizens so that they may learn.\nAccording to Fafunwa (1980), as society becomes increasingly complex and becomes ever more institutionalized, educational experience become less directly related to daily life but more interesting in future endeavors. The concentrations of learning in a formal atmosphere allow children to learn more of their culture than they are able to do by more observing and imitating. A society attaches more importance to education. It also tries to formulate the overall objectives, content organization and strategies of education. Olatunde (2002) asserts that the function of education is related to the society and the individual on the society level, it helps each individual to become a functional member of her society by passing along to him the collective experiences of the past and present so as to enable him integrate with future and the inherent challenges therein. At personal level, it enables the individual to lead a more satisfying and productive life by preparing him to handle new emerging experience independently and successfully. Fafunwa (1974) writing on national Philosophy on Education, in consonance with the government educational policy writes on what should be the roles and functions of public \"education in the development of the individual for national program and national reconstruction and educational values worth developing. Nigeria education is geared towards self-realization, better human relationship, national consciousness, national unity, social and political progress, scientific and technological progress and national reconstruction.\nMoreso, Taiwo (1980) observes that educational system influenced, shaped and determined by a number of factors and circumstances among these are historical, social, political and economic factors. It then becomes imperative for the planners of the country\"s educational system to relate education to individual and societal needs. Education is an inalienable right of an individual (NPE) (1981) states that the Federal Government of Nigeria has adopted education as an instrument per excellence for effective national development. It should be noted that a well-defined qualitative education will lift a nation from an under developed country to a welldeveloped nation. The level of development and civilization of any nation is always determined by its educational standard.\nNo one even, a nation has ever disputed the fact that, education is a variable instrument for liberating people from the shackles of ignorance, illiteracy, poverty and the likes. There is over whelming evidence that education is a weapon in the fight against poverty. In the same vein, education is also useful to fight for ones rights itself being a basic natural human right. The roles right itself being a basic natural human right. The roles of education towards the development of the individual, the society and the nation as whole cannot be over emphasized, hence, there is need to give proper adequate and equal education to everybody, regardless of sex. Yolah (2001) asserts that education is a harbinger potentialities so essential for full productive life. Adamu (1999) maintained that formal education has been recognized as a means through which political, economic, social change as well as religious sectors can be fostered. Education is one of Nigeria\"s biggest industries and it touches on every human endeavor in any given society. Education is regarded as an instrument that later germinates good fruit for society. It teaches knowledge, attitude and skills that liberates, empowers and permits self-actualization.\n\nTHE CONCEPT OF ISLAMIC EDUCATION\nIslam as a religion gives premium value to education and has faith spread among diverse people education became imperative tool towards realizing a universal and cohesive social order. Islam has a religion with divine purpose encompasses all spheres of human endeavor including education Islamic education has its origin from Islam. According to Nasir (1991) Islamic education is the kind of education, which is given according to the injunction of the Quran and Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW) so that the child can live a happy, pious, upright and useful life. Lemu (ND) Opine that the Islamic concept of education can be understood from its aim and objectives. The true aims of education according to the consensus of Muslim scholars is to facilitate the balanced growth of the personality of man thorough the training of man\"s spirit, intellectual, rational self-feeling and bodily senses. Islamic education is built around the development of a balanced personality comparable to the prophet as described in (Q33v21) Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammed (SAW) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (Meeting with) Allah and the last day and remember Allah always\". The teaching of the tenets of Islam like those bothering on character (akhlaq) enhance the deep comprehension of tire value of Islam itself, its teachings on God man relationship and its teaching on man to man relationship. It is but a perfect code of life which embodied among other things, socio economic, political legal and intellectual sphere of human life. Islamic education will enhance the following for the Muslim children. 1.Make them realize their purpose of creation 2.Enable them to make conscious effort toward achieving the purpose of religion (Islam) as a complete way of life. 3.Make efforts towards attaining success in this life and hereafter. 4.Recognize the moral precepts of Islam which they must internalize and be influenced by. 5.Put into the instruments which Islam prescribes for the Muslim towards maintaining moral relationship with God, the creator and cordial relationship with fellow human being. 6. Appreciate the Islamic culture, which must be projected and preserved.\nThe discipline aims at building society where tolerance, love and brotherhood are predominant. It serve as a tool in the liberation of the individual from selfishness, exploitation and hatred. It is also to liberate man from the darkness of this world to the light of Islam from the shackles of oppression and tyranny of man to his fellow human, being to the open space and freedom in all ramifications Islamic education also creates integrated, personalities and prepares both the learner and teacher for better living in this world and the hereafter. It also focuses on the material needs of man (Saaba (2002) such knowledge acquired with moral and spiritual values can never be instrument of evil. It is compulsory on every Muslim either male or Female, old or young to seek for Islamic education, acquire it and put it into use for the prophet (SAW) was reported by Abu Hurayah that he said, \"seeking for knowledge is compulsory on the male and female Muslim (Burkari) from this saying, it can be inferred that acquiring Islamic education is compulsory. This also justifies the inclusion of Islamic education in the school curriculum. An x-ray of Islamic education curriculum reveals that the aim of it is to inculcate the Islamic moral value in the students. It is against this back drop that moral objectives in our educational programme is being laid. At the Nigerian Certificate in Education (NCE) level the discipline aims at developing \"God consciousness\" in the students and ensuring that they uphold the value and teachings of Islam. Undoubtedly, the teaching of Islamic studies effectively at all levels of Nigeria educational system will inculcate in Nigeria\"s right from childhood the consciousness of Allah, the Omnipotent and Omniscient.\n\nBRIEF HISTORY OF ISLAMIC EDUCAION IN NIGERIA\nIslamic education is as old as Islam itself Nigeria. According to Fafunwa (1974) Islamic religion is the basic of Islamic education, it is education in Islamic context and culture. Islam came to West Africa through the trade merchant in the 7 th century. Islam cam to Nigeria through the North. It was brought in the early 14 th century by traders, scholars, cattle rearers. It came through the trans-aharan trade route. Their first point of call was kanem Borno in about 986 C E from where it spread to Kastina, kano, Sokoto, Borno, Bauchi and Nupe. Kano had been centre of Islamic learning as far back as 16 th Century. In these places, they established Islamic centres of learning and also introduced books on divinity and technology Islam further spread to Ilorin, Ibadan, Oyo, iseyin, Abeokuta. By the beginning of 20 th century, Islamic education had started to enjoy wide popularity in the south western part of Nigeria.\nWhatever Islam spread, rudimentary knowledge of the Quran, the Hadith, Sharia, Shirah e.t.c are still taught to its followers. One of the factors that aided the spread of Islamic education is the emphasis the prophet put on seeking of knowledge. One of such prophetic advice is \"the best man among you is the one who learns the Quran and then cares to teachers other\" (Bukhari).\nAccording to Fafunwa (1974) learn are brought under the same roof often referred to as \"makaranta to receive training under a competent teacher (mallam) Islamic education is also literate, functional and is international in standard.\nThe sole aim of Islamic Education in its developmental stages, Islamic education in Nigeria was characterized by feature that differ from the western oriented education system.\nThere was no clear cut division into primary, secondary and tertiary levels.\nThere was no classes, no age limit, and no rigid time table with neatly timed periods for subject. What we have instead is a structure of utmost simplicity.\nAccording to Fafunwa (1974) he assert that Islamic teacher wanders from place to place looking for charitable Muslim to shelter him. This reduced the status of a teacher (Mallam) to that of a begger. He came to occupy socially a rather low status. He described the essence and structure of teaching Islamic education as such that did not facilitate performance in learning. He inferred that in a typical Quranic school the teacher sits under a tree or in a parlour, verandah or posh, surrounded by volumes of the Quran and other Islamic books.\nA little further off, but near enough to be within reach is his long cane, surrounded some ten to forty pupils in a semi-circle. The teacher is assisted by one of the pupils who is considered. The brightest or the oldest or both.\nAs early as third year of life, Muslim children are expected to start the first stage of Qur\"anic education. At this stage, the pupils learn the shorter chapters of the Quran. Through repetition and by rote, the pleasure they derive from the system at this stage lies in the choral recitation, which often follows a sing song pattern. The teacher explains the Arabic text, which is often difficult for the pupils. Furthermore, pupils are introduced to other aspect such exegesis of the Quran (Tafsir). Theology, hadith, jurisprudence, logix, Arithmetic etc. at this level the translation is being adopted and students still used reception in readings. It is at this stage that a student chooses a specific field he is going to specialize. Malik (1993) observed that the Muslim parents in the south, felt reluctant in enrolling their children in Christian Mission schools for fear of being converted to Christianity. This, further arouses their interest in setting up Quranic schools. At time went on, the western education with conducive environment, availability of furniture and variety of subjects that could make the products of such become professionals in different fields led to a relative decline of students enrolling for qur\"anic schools in some areas the interest of some Muslim children and their parent were developed towards western education.\n\nINRODUCTION OF REFORMS INTO ISLAMIC EDUCATION\nAfter seeing the rate of decline in enrolment in Quaranic schools due to the presence of western oriented school and the insufficiency of Arabic and Islamic studies teacher Fafunwa (1987) asserts that in 1934 a school was set up in Kano by Alhaji Abdullahi Bayero called Northern provinces law school and was later change to school for Arabic Studies and Islamic Studies and maintained by the government. The school was charged with the responsibility to train teachers for Arabic and Islamic studies subjects as well as English and Arithmetic. The government introduced a scheme by which untrained junior primary school teachers attended course at school for Arabic and Islamic studies. The then Northern Region Ministry of Education and Northern Province law school which metamorphosed to Abdullahi Bayero College worked out comprehensive plan whereby the traditional way of imparting knowledge is directed to follow the westernized ways so as to bring uniformity at the pre-university level.\nThe school of Arabic studies at Sokoto started in this direction. In the south, university of Ibadan established department of Arabic and Islamic studies in which one year certificate course and two year Diploma course was introduced.\nThis is meant to raise the poor status and standard of Arabic teachers and graduates of the traditional schools. But despite the training they have undergone, the certificate was not recognized by the ministry of education when presented for employment Balogun (1983). Yaqub (1986) asserts that due to the problem caused by western education through absence of Arabic and Islamic studies in its curriculum brought about the demand and agitation by the Muslim for the introduction of these two subject and the establishment of Muslim schools. In achieving this demand balogun (1983) asserts: in their effort to preserve the knowledge of Arabic and Islamic culture, some Muslim dignitaries in Nigeria Held a meeting in 1953, with the then Northern Region minister off education, kaduna, with the view of including Arabic and Islamic Religion Knowledge\"s among the subjects for the West African Examination Council (WAEC) consequently school starts to preparing for examination in both subjects in the late fifties\" In further response to the agitation of the Muslim, the colonial government established the first Muslim organisation like Zumratul Islamiyyah, Ansarudeen nawar-ud-deen etc set to their own school to cater for both Islamic and western education. The name \"Islamic Studies\" was officially adopted in 1983 as the name for the teaching of Islamic education taught in primary and post primary schools in Nigeria. It was adopted at the first workshop of Islamic the auspices of the Nigeria education Research Council (NER) now NERC. At the end of the workshop the Nation Islamic studies curriculum was fashioned and published in 1985 by the Federal Ministry of Education. The reason advanced for choosing the title \"Islamic Studies\" that it is more appropriate and comprehensive to the subject matter in the curriculum than Islamic Religion knowledge.\n\nTHE STATUS of ISLAMIC STUDIES IN NATIONAL POLICY OF EDUCATION\nNigeria is a non-theocratic nation. It is a multi-religion nation that guaranteed the freedom of worship and the freedom of religious instructions as embedded in Nigeria\"s constitution, with effective constitution protection.\nThe 1999 constitution of federal republic of Nigeria chapter iii, subsection 2 states: \"no person attending any place of education shall be required to receive religious instruction or observance relates to a religion other than his own or a religion not approved by his parent or guardian\".\nThe federal Republic of Nigeria national Policy on Education section 1 Subsection7 (ii) States on page 5 as follows \"Opportunity will continue to be made available for religious instruction. No child will be forced to accept any religious instruction which is contrary to the wishes of his parents\" Section3, subsection 15(v) also states \"For improving the teaching moral and religious education. Government will ensure through the various ministries of education, the provision of suitable curriculum and the training of teachers for the subject\" With the above quotation from the constitution of the country and National Policy on Education it can be easily understood that there is Jurisdiction for the inclusion of Islamic studies in the school subject. In the national policy on education (1981) and also revised (1988) provision is made for the teaching of Islamic studies as a core subject in Junior Secondary school and as an elective in senior secondary school, Islamic studies is also geared toward achieving the broad aim of the national\"s educational system among others is the preparation of youth for better living within the society and above all, the desire to raise a generation of people who can thinks for themselves, respect these views and feelings of others respect the dignity of labor, appreciate good values and lives as a good citizens . The relevance of Islamic studies, as a component of the school syllabus in facilitating the achievement of this part of the policy especially in a multi religious society like Nigeria cannot be over emphasized.\n\nATTITUDES OF STUDENTS TOWARD ISLAMIC STUDIES\nIt is unfortunate that despite the fact that the government through the school curriculum provides equal opportunity for the Muslim and Christian students to know more about their religion the Muslim students have always shown lackadaisical attitudes to Islamic studies. This has always been expressed in different forms. First, most student do not always attend the class especially in the senior secondary school class. This they base their argument on the fact that it is not compulsory for them since whether they pass or fail it they will still be promoted to the next class if other compulsory subjects are passed. Most of them see Islamic studies teacher as replica of their Arabic Teachers who always beat them. To some students, there is no Justification for the inclusion of Islamic studies in the school time tables.\nThis they believe they have been taught all what is in the Islamic studies curriculum at their Arabic school, which in essence is tantamount to waste of time and irrelevance.\n\nANALYSIS OF STUDENTS STUDYING ISLAMIC STUDIES IN TAI SOLARIN UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION (TASUED).\nThe For the third year the college admitted 2 only while Christian religious studies 10 and history 50 respectively. For the fourth year, the college admitted 5 while 8 and 23 students were admitted for Christian religious studies and history respectively. The table shown that the number of students admitted for Islamic studies in the first year was low compared subsequent years.\n\nCAUSES OF APATHY OF STUDENTS TOWARD ISLAMIC STUDIES IN HIGHER INSTITUTION\nAccording to oxford advanced learners dictionary (2001). Apathy is defined as the feeling of not being interested in or enthusiastic about anything. Also Longman Dictionary of contemporary English 2002 defined apathy as the feeling of not being interested or not caring either about a particular thing or life.\nThe attitude of most Muslim especially those studying in higher institution shows that most of them show apathy to studying Islamic studies in comparison to other courses in faculty or school of art and social sciences.\nThe causes of this apathy are: 1. Government grand design 2. Problem of educational administration 3. Parental Problem 4. Attitudes of students and wrong notion 5. Problem of Arabic 6. Social Influence 7. Inferiority complex of students GOVERNMENT GRAND DESIGN: It is unfortunate to say that most of the problems encountered by Islamic studies in secondary school does not occur without the knowledge of the government. Starting from when the three region were still in existence in 1959. The western Region government after realizing that there were not enough Islamic studies teachers in secondary schools started recruiting Islamic studies teachers to teach in both secondary and primary schools. This excise has been abandoned since 1968. Those there were employed were not provided with refresher courses to upgrade their knowledge Agbetola (1980). Also in 1975, the Western state government introduced a one year programme under the free universal primary education scheme for the training of teachers of Islamic studies. The programme was handles jointly by the department of Arabic and Islamic studies and the faculty of Education both in the University of Ibadan. The first twenty one intake were also the last set of students to attend the programme.\nAgbetola (1998) notes that to further complicate the issue many of those trained teachers who came for the one-year course were made not to teach Islamic studies in their various schools on the pretext of giving them their duty posts as head of giving them their duty post as head of schools. Also, Islamic studies have not been given its due position in the national policy on education.\nIslamic studies remains on the elective list in our senior secondary school subjects. This assumption stems from the erroneous belief of the secularity nature of Nigeria and therefore cannot make Islamic studies an elective subject in senior secondary school, the curriculum for Islamic studies in junior secondary school is overloaded such that it is impossible for teachers to teach the topic very well and also finish the syllabus of each level.\nAlso Uthman (2002) asserts that there are some universities and colleges of education in which non-Muslim are appointed lecturers of Arabic and Islamic studies.\nThough, some of them have distinguishes themselves in the field of Arabic. But it is a known fact that a person who does not believe in the beauty of Islam cannot teach the course efficiently without bias. This does make some students not to be willing to study the course since they know and believe that a non-Muslim cannot convey the message satisfactorily.\nThe government has also relegated the subject to the background in the area of administration. This happens mostly during the military era. This is usually done by promoting holders of certificate of other disciplines at the expense of holder of certificate of Islamic Studies. In most cases, degree holders of Islamic studies do not always go beyond the position of director in both state and federal ministries of Education no matter their accumulated experience in administration Jafar (2001). This is due to the erroneous belief that Islamic studies is a COLLECTION OF RITUALS relevant only in the mosque. Recently, the Osun state government retrenched some teachers retrenched was Islamic studies teachers to the Islamic studies teachers, the government advised them to go and preach I the mosque where their services are needed.\nThis shows the bias mind the government has for the subject and also will make anybody who want to study the course in higher institution to have second thought before accepting the offer of admission for it. The government has also failed to fund education very well. This has affected mostly the salary of teachers and provision of required teaching and learning materials. The teachers have found it very hard to keep faith with their teaching assignment.\n\nPROBLEM OF EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION\nThis refers to those that are at helms of affair in the schools and colleges of Education, there are some heads of school who use their position of authority to suppress Islam for the other religion i.e. Christian simply because they have no proprietor whose religious interest they are to protect and promote Uthman (2002) observes that this is common in most public schools.\nAvailable evidence shows that there is not enough freedom of worship and freedom to receive one\"s religious instruction for the Muslim children in most public schools and a lot of Christina owned institutions. Uthman further observes that student religion knowledge and to take part in all modes of Christian worship. There have been several cases in which the deliberately omitted on the time-table. There are also cases in which teachers posted to school to teach Islamic studies are later converted to another subject teacher by the school heads there are also cases in which the Islamic studies teacher is always been over burden with other school assignment and extra-curriculum activities such that he will not have enough time for the subject and himself. There are many colleges of Education and faculty of education in universities to combat the shortage of teachers in the country.\nMany of these colleges are not skeptical about the inclusion of Islamic studies and Christian Religious Studies as separate courses combinable with other courses. Conversely, there are few which do not want to accommodate Islamic studies at all. An example of such college, which is religiously intolerant to Islam is the college of Education at Ikere Ekiti. Agbetola (1980) notes that in 1975, spite all representation and rains of protest letters to the authority of the college and to it superior officers in the state ministry of Education, this anomaly was not corrected to favor the inclusion of Islamic studies as a separate discipline and as a combinable subject with other sister subjects in the group of Humanities. The use of the term Religious studies to have included Islamic studies is an attempt to deceive thousands of Muslim taxpayers in Ondo State and nation as a whole. Like college of Education ikere Ekiti, most college of education Ikere Ekiti. Most college of education and faculty of education do not always recruit Islamic studies.\nIt will be recalled that when the college advertised for the recruitment of teachers of Religious studies some times in 1979/1980 session, many graduates of Arabic and Islamic studies in Higher Institution applied.\nIt is on record that no one of those appoint able and competent graduate were invited for interview furthermore, many students, who were qualifies to read Islamic studies and applied for admission were appointed on the pretext that there were no teachers or Lecturers. And where as the aspect of same college was given to the lecturers of Christian religious studies to teach. If there are no discrimination on the ground of religion with regard to access to places of welfare and utility, why is Islamic studies in these colleges and faculties of Education.\n3. PARENTAL PROBLEM: it is a known fact that parent plat and important roles in choice of course of their children. Many parents always dictate the course of study for their children. Whenever their children want to choose any course which they feel be little their social status on their children status, they do turn them away from it. Many parents prefer course that will boost their ego and status and to them is creative forgetting the fact that it only Allah that shower, blessings to whatever ones engages in also, most often parents do not always like their children to study Islamic studies at higher institution. They have that erroneous belief that it is not marketable and anybody that studies it will end up being a teacher and might not be reckoned with when matters concerning education are being discussed some parent even prefer that their children should stays at home rather than studying Islamic studies. It is only those that are conscious of religion and firmly believed. That blessings come only from Allah that allow their children to study the course. Some parents also believe that if their children study any religious course especially Islamic studies such children becomes fanatic, therefore, they debar their children from studying it. And even go to the extent of threatening such child with not paying his school fees if he remains adamants.\n\nATTITUDES OF STUDENTS AND WRONG NOTION:\nThere are some students because of their experience at secondary school will not like to offer the course at Higher institution. This may because by their Islamic studies teacher or the government who might have failed to provide teacher for the subject thereby perceiving it as inferior or fail to motivate them by providing incentives for them, the students who have not been taught this subject both their elementary and secondary school levels of education will develop erroneous notion against the course in tertiary institution and may not be motivated to study it. Also, there are some students who believe that there are some courses which are more lucrative and marketable and more recognized than others. When such are asked about what they intend to study in tertiary institution, hardly will you see anybody mentioning Islamic studies because they think Islamic studies is not relevant and lucrative. 5. PROBLEM OF ARABIC LANGUAGE: without an iota of doubt, Arabic language is the backbone of Islamic studies. It is the language in which the Quran was revealed which is the primary book of Islam. The prophet (SAW) was an Arab and the language in which he preached was Arabic.\nThus, it is very difficult to draw a line of demarcation. For anybody who wants to study Islamic studies, he must be averagely proficient in Arabic. But unfortunately, most students who are always admitted to study Islamic studies do not have good foundation in Islamic studies. Most of them think it is possible to study Islamic studies knowing how to read and write in Arabic. Also because of the poor foundation most of them have in Arabic, they are not motivate to study Islamic studies in tertiary institution and develop the erroneous notion that the course is too difficult to learn especially those of the who did not attend Quranic School before. 6. INFERIORITY COMPLEX OF THE STUDENT: -it is unfortunate that most students of Islamic studies always feel inferior among their colleagues on campus. Often, when some of they are asked about their course of study either at home or on campus, they mention other courses, which they feel are superior to Islamic studies. This always creates the impression in some students who are always creators the impression n some students who are yet to be admitted and other people that the course in irrelevant and not worth of studying. Adetona (2003). 7. SOCIAL INFLUENCE: -It is known fact that education is the only legacy which any parent can bequeath his or her children. Also, it is agreed that there is no education without good character. A critical analysis of our contemporary society shows that there is moral degeneration and lack of ethical orientation. The preponderance of moral decadence e.g. cultism, drug addict etc. in the country could be traced to the secular features already entrenched in the running of the society Uthman (2002). These secular features have also affect adversely the teaching and learning of Islamic studies in public schools as displayed by lack of interest in Islamic studies by the students. Uthman (2002) asserts that the society does not attach value to Islamic studies rather they see it as not necessary in the curriculum for the development of the nation. The society also find it difficult to differentiate Islamic studies in school from the Arabic class organized at home for Muslim children. They see both of them at aims at achieving the same end and therefore are a repetition. Some people in the society believe religion is a personal affair.\n\nEFFECTS OF APATHY OF STUDENTS TOWARD ISLAMIC STUDIES IN HIGHER INSTITUTION\nThe apathy of students towards Islamic studies has led some unsanitary effects on the school system and Islamic studies as school subject. Some of the effects are: 1. Moral laxity 2. Inadequate of Islamic Studies 3. Relegation of Islamic Studies 4. Poor Understanding of students concerning their religion 1. MORAL LAXITY: The rate of morality is on the increase in our schools today the family or parent who supposed to give the child the primary moral aspect of life has neglected its duties. It has been shifted to school which itself has been secular due to the nature of the society and provides little or no moral education for the students. Morality which is the norm of education has now departed our schools. The major cause of this is that religious education especially Islamic studies have been taken with levity by the school authority it has not been allowed to achieve its aims of inclusion in the school curriculum.\n\nINADEQUATE OF ISLAMIC STUDIES TEACHERS:\nDue to the gross decline in the number of students who enrolls for Islamic studies in tertiary institution this has led to the inadequacy in number of Islamic studies teacher in both primary and secondary school. It is unfortunate that most schools do not always have required number of Islamic studies teaches in their schools in some cases there is total lack of it.\n\nRELEGATION OF ISLAMIC STUDIES\nBecause of the apathy of students towards Islamic studies some schools always deliberately omitted it from the school time table as if the subject is not existing. This creates impression that Islamic studies is not a subject being offered in the school or there are no Muslim in the school.\n\nRESERCH METHODOLOGY RESEARCH DESIGN\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the validity of the variables mention earlier in the hypothesis. These variables include societal attitudes determine students\" attitude toward Islamic Studies in Higher Institution Most student consider Islamic studies as irrelevant course in Higher Institution etc.\nIn carrying out the research, a descriptive design approach was used, it adopted the strongly agree, agree, strong disagree, disagree and undecided. Each of the hypothesis were postulated and tested. Base on this analysis were carried out and interpreted.\n\nPOPULATION OF THE STUDY\nThe targeted population involved, student of Tai Solaring University of Education (TAUSUED).\n\nSAMPLE AND SAMPLING PROCEDURE\nStudents from the department in college of Humanities and Social Science were selected as population. The department are Islamic Studies, Christian Religious Studies, Yoruba Economics, Accounting, Geography, and history, Creative Arts, Social Studies and Political Science.\n\nINSTRUMENTS FOR DATA COLLECTION\nIn testing the hypotheses, the instrument used was a questionnaire, various textbooks were also consulted. The questionnaire was divided into parts. The first part requires the respondent to indicate his/her age, sex, department and course of study and level. The second part takes care of four sections, each section contains ten items which relates to the four hypotheses developed for this study. Respondents are expected to tick the column in front of each item which best expresses their feeling based a fair point scale.\nThe following were constructed form of scale; it ranges from strongly agree (SA) Agree (A) Strongly Disagree (SD), Disagreed (D) and Undecided. The questionnaire was administered personally by hand and collected some hours later. Each respondent was allowed to respond freely to the statement of questionnaire without any form of influence.\n\nPROCEDURE FOR DATA COLLECTION\nThe instrument was personally served to the respondents by the researcher, To carry out this research, the researcher visited the department in the college.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\nAfter the questionnaire has been collected, the researcher examine them and checked if they were properly completed them and checked if they were properly completed considering the nature of this research. The data collected was analyzed logically in a tabular form. Only the questionnaire that were fully completed were used in analyzing the data and in testing the hypothesis the percentage of those that agree and disagreed were collected by first obtaining the frequency of those who agreed and those who disagreed. This was done by merging strongly agreed with agreed. This was also done for the strongly disagreed and disagreed.\n\nRESEARCH ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\nThis section shows the descriptive analysis of the data for the study through the questionnaire administered to tri-students. To test the four hypotheses formulated earlier on the topic. \"The Apathy of students towards the study of Islamic Studies in Higher Institution. A case study of Tai Solarin University of Education.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\nThe Questionnaire is divided into two sections namely A and B Section A dealt with personal information such as Age, Sex, Department, Course of study and level.\nSection A Table 1 Age Distribution of Respondents  Age  Frequency  Percentage  17-22 18 45% 23-Above 22 55% Total 40 100% From the above table, forty respondents were given the questionnaire out of which 18 (45%) were between the age of 17-22 years while 22 (55%) of the respondents were between the age of 23 and above. The implication of this is that the respondents were the set of mature students.  Table iv shows that majority of those that completed the questionnaire were those that have stayed on campus for at least a year and possessed the experience.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\nThe information gathered under this sub-heading were divided into four (4) different tables and followed by the hypothesis, which ascertained the relationship between the responses and the statement of the hypothesis. In this research work, as earlier shown, forty (40) questionnaire were distributed to the targeted areas and a total of forty (4) questionnaires were returned and simple parentage was used. For the analysis. Hypothesis to be tested Hypothesis One Hoi: SOCIETAL ATTITUDE DETERMINES\n\nSTUDENTS ATTITUDE TOWARDS STUDYING ISLAMIC STUDIES IN HIGHER INSTITUTION.\nTo test the ability of first hypothesis, the frequency, mean and standard deviation of responses on each item was obtained and equally used to complete the percentage and correlation to make decisions as shown by the breakdown of the analysis. FINDING: The finding show that 106 (53%) of the entire respondents agreed with the notion that the societal attitude: determines students attitudes toward studying Islamic studies in Higher institution, while 89 (44 1/2 %) of the total respondents disagreed with the statement. There is, also 5 (2 1/2 %) of the total number of respondent did not decide whether or not the societal attitude determine, students attitude towards studying Islamic studies in Higher Institution. From the table above it is clearly shown that the hypothesis was accepted and correct based on the larger population that agreed with the hypothesis.\n\nHYPOTHESIS TWO Ho2\" STUDENT ATTITUDES TOWARDS STUDYING ISLAMIC STUDIES IN HIGHER INSTITUTION WILL DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THEIR EXPERIENCE IN SECONDARY SCHOOL\nTo test the validity of the second hypothesis, which is stated above, the data was collected analyzed as shown below. FINDING: The finding showed that 148 (74%) of the entire respondents supported the assertion that students attitude toward studying Islamic studies in Higher Institution will depend to a large extent on their experience in secondary schools, 44 (22%) disagreed while 8 (4%) of the entire respondents are undecided. It is worthy of note that the hypothesis was strongly agreed by the highest figure of total number of respondents. This was supported based on the fact that the government is not given adequate attention to educational sector as especially in the area of payment of salary, motivation, recruitment of more teachers etc. this has manifested in many ways such as inadequacy of Islamic studies teachers poor performance of students in Islamic studies etc. Table III FINDING: From the response of the hypothesis, it shows that 123 (61 1/2 %) agreed with the statement in the hypothesis while also 70 (35%) disagreed with the assertion and 7 (3 1/2 %) are yet to decide whether or not parents attitude and perception influence the choice of course of study of their children. But it could be inferred that the hypothesis which says that parents attitude and perception on the choice of course of their children in Higher Institution was accepted and agreed with by the highest number of the respondents which represents 123 (61 1/2 %). FINDING: the finding shows that 107 (53 1/2 %) of the entire respondents support the assertion that most students consider Islamic studies as irrelevant course in Higher Institution, 87 (43 1/2 %) disagreed while 6 (3%) of the entire respondent are undecided.\n\nDISCUSSION OF THE FINDINGS, SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS INRODUCTION\nThe main purpose of this research work is to investigate the apathy of students towards the study of Islamic studies in Higher Institution. Tai Solarin University of Education as a case study. The chapter sets to discuss the findings as well as the summary of the study, conclusion and recommendations were also dealt with in this chapter.\n\nDISCUSS OF FINDINGS\nThe section will explain the findings of the data earlier stated in chapter four. The first hypothesis states that \"social attitude determines students attitude towards studying Islamic studies in higher institution. It was supported by 106 (53%( of the respondents, 89 (44 1/2 %) disagreed while only 5 (2 1/2 %) did not decide whether truly societal attitude determine or not. However, the first item of the statement where 18 (45%) agreed that the society attaches value to Islamic studies while 21 (52%) disagreed while 1 (2 1/2 %) did not decide. This implies that an average man in the society gives less value to Islamic studies. This data shows that it is not totally irrelevant or too low in standard in comparison with other courses. This is due to the contemporary multi religious nature of the society which we are in which many people detach from religion and incline to mundane life and materialism is the other of the day Olatunde (2002). This makes most people to have less value for religious education which Islamic studies is among. The society gives premium to other course which they believe are more relevant to the society as sit could be seen in 5 th item of the questionnaire in which 23(51 1/2 %) of the respondents agreed with the statement that Islamic studies is not: lucrative and marketable while 16 (40%) disagreed and 1 (2.5%) did not decide. This further stressed the fact that most people see Islamic studies to be more religious in its content: For the second hypothesis which state students\" attitude toward studying Islamic studies in Higher Institution will depend to a large extent on their experience in secondary school. 148 (74%) agreed, 44 (22%) disagreed while 8 (4%) of the entire respondents are undecided.\nHowever, look at the seventh (12) item of the questionnaire 17 (42 1/2 %) agreed with the statement that Islamic studies teachers are not decide. The percentage of the disagreed respondents implies that Islamic studies teachers are dedicated and hardworking. Though according to the 10 th item on the questionnaire 30(75%) agreed that students performance in Islamic studies is low while 8 (20%) disagreed and 2 (5%) did not decide. This poor performance in Islamic studies can be attributed to many factors among which is the negative attitude of some school authorities towards learning Islamic studies is also pointed out by the ninth item respondents agreed that school in secondary school, while 3 (7 1/2 %) disagreed and 3 (7 1/2 %) did not decide. This implies further that school through hampering of the subject.\nAccording to Akinola (1993) this they carried out through many ways among which is the changing of subject to be taught for Islamic students teachers posted to schools. This the school authorities carried out under the guise that some subjects are lacking teachers which are very important to the students than Islamic and that Islamic studies teachers should be able to teach the subject combined with Islamic studies. This some school authorities make the teacher to be frustrated and left with the option of either to take the combined subjects with Islamic studies or seek for reposting. This eventually affects the student\"s performance since there is nobody to teach them the subject. The further support the sixth item in which 37 (95.2%) of respondents agreed that the Islamic studies teacher are not enough in public school while 2 (5%) disagreed 1 (2 1/2 %)n did not decide.\nThe third hypothesis which stipulates that parents attitudes and perception influence the choice of course of study of their children in Higher institution was accepted by 123(61 1/2 %) of the total respondents, 70 (35%) of the total respondents disagreed with the assertion and 7 (3 1/2 %) did not decide. The implication of this is that parents are not more interested in the educational pursuit of their children. However, the percentage of those that disagreed still shows that parents attitude and perception still influence the course of study of their children in Higher Institution. Looking at the 12 th item of the questionnaire which states that parent do encourage their children to study Islamic studies 9 (22 1/2 %) agreed with the statement while 27 (67 1/2 %) disagreed and 4 (10%) did not decide.\nThis implies that Muslim parents give preference to other course at the expense of Islamic studies. This was also noted by Lemu (ND) in which he asserts that in modern society that a high is being given to other forms of education at the expenses of Islamic education. To further corroborate this fact in 15 th item of questionnaire 29 (72 1/2 %) agreed with the assertion that Muslim parents attach less value to Islamic studies while 11 (27 1/2 %) disagreed.\nThis further implies that Muslim parents have not fully reckoned with Islamic studies as a course to be studies and this has affected the number of students studying the course in Higher Institution. Also, today most Muslim parents believe that religion is a private affair and this has equally affected them in seeking and allowing their children to study religion education in Higher Institution.\nOn the fourth hypothesis, which states that most students consider Islamic studies as irrelevant course in Higher institution 7 (53 1/2 %) of the entire respondents agreed with the assertion while 87 (43 1/2 %) disagreed and 6 (3%) did not decide. Looking at the 16 th item of the questionnaire 1(27%) agreed with the assertion that Islamic studies is not worthwhile of studying in higher institution while 29 (72 1/2 %), disagreed with the assertion. This is contrary with the 18 th item on the questionnaire which states \"Islamic studies is inferior to other course 20 (50%) of the entire respondents agreed while 17 (42 1/2 %) disagreed and 3 (7 1/2 %) did not decide. The inferiority of the course can be called artificial one which can be attributed to the students might have for the course. Adetona (2003) noted that some Islamic studies students always feel inferior to other students of other courses due to wrong notion.\nThis has made some people to think that Islamic studies is inferior to other courses when some of the Islamic studies are always shy of mentioning other course of study outside and are not always proud of it. This was revealed by the 17 th item of the questionnaire in which 17 (42 1/2 %) of the entire respondents agreed with the statement Islamic studies students are always proud of their course 22 (55%) disagreed with the assertion and 1 (25 1/2 %) did not decide. This has further created an impression that Islamic studies is not worthwhile of studying in Higher Institution.\n\nSUMMARY\nThe main objective of this research is critically looked into apathy of students towards the studying of Islamic studies in Higher Institution Tai Solarin University of Education as a case study. In the course of investigating the problem of apathy of students towards Islamic studies in higher institution, questionnaire was used to collect the data on it. The concept of education was critically analyzed as well as that of Islamic education. Equally the brief history of Islamic education in Nigeria, which was dated back to 986 CE in which it came through the Northern part of Nigeria. Attempt was also made to examine the status of Islamic studies in National Policy of education. A critique was also made of the analysis of students studying Islamic studies in Tai Solarin University of Education in comparison with social studies and Christian Religious studies. The cause of apathy was seriously looked into and some likely solutions were proffered which are capable of solving the problems.\nIn the chapter four of this work result analysis was made on the various data collected through the questionnaire prepared. However, during the course of analyzing the data collected in chapter IV, it clearly showed that all four-hypothesis were accepted and valid.\n\nConclusion\nWith regard to this research work which is meant to look into the apathy of students towards the study of Islamic studies in higher institution. A case study of Tai Solarin University of Education Attempt were made to explain the causes of apathy of student towards Islamic studies in Higher Institution. It was revealed that the apathy of students has created inadequacy of Islamic studies teachers in primary and post primary school, due to the fact most students do not want to study the course in higher institution. Also Muslim parents have not encourage their children and wards to develop a positive attitude to Islamic studies. This is due to fact that most Muslim parents now give premium to other forms of education. Furthermore, the finding revealed that inferiority complex often displayed by some Islamic studies students has created a wrong notion in people that Islamic studies is not worthwhile of studying in Higher institution. Since the national Policy of education recognized Islamic studies as one of the subjects in both primary and secondary school and the NCCE recognized it as a one the course to be offered at the college of education. Islamic studies as a course is relevant in the education system of Nigeria and could be pursued as a course in higher institution. However, the general conclusion is that societal belief and attitude have greatly affected the study of the course in higher institution. It is therefore incumbent on Muslim in educational sector and Muslims that are religiously conscious to sensitize people especially the Muslim on the relevancy and the need for Islamic studies in Nigeria educational system and to raise in status.\n\nRecommendation\nThe following recommendation will be of immense benefits in solving the problem of apathy of students to Islamic studies in Higher institution. This concern the students, teacher and the society and the government.\n\nPROFFERED SOLUTION TO THE APATHY OF STUDENTS TOWARDS ISLAMIC STUDIES\nHaving seen the unwholesome consequences of the apathy of students toward the study of Islamic studies in higher institution. It will be of immense benefit to provide necessary solutions to the problem. This will help in a long way in curbing the solution.\nTo this, the following solutions are preferred. (1) Good Remuneration for teachers (2) Change in parent belief and attitudes (3) Provision of Arabic Remedial class"

              "The Aurat March (2018-2022) in the Context of Gendered-Islamophobia: A Case of Muslim Women’s Identity in Pakistan\n\nThe role and identity of Muslim women around the world is one of the crucial issues in the current era. Women rights’ activists and other contributors seek to highlight women issues through their work and marches. The present research explores that how these marches are contributing hugely in presenting the image of women in any country to the world. The researcher addresses the cultural and religious differences in terms of gendered Islamophobia and the impact of Aurat March while constructing or contesting the women identity in Pakistani society. Through an analysis of Aurat March , researcher highlights the ways in which the biased representation of Muslim women lives can be either limiting or encouraging. The impact of these events can be reason of rise in negative attitudes and scattered stereotypes, or it might initiate peaceful dialogues and affective measures. The research also analyzes that how a minor negligence can be an additional certificate in the world of Islamophobia and an increase in international narratives against Muslims, Islam, and Pakistani society. The research paper seeks to argue how Aurat March , influenced by secular modern trends transmit Islamophobic stereotypes towards Islam: Muslim women, in general, and Pakistan in specific context. The paper will conclude by analyzing the important insights to counter the gendered Islamophobia in the lives of Muslim women while limiting themselves into gender, culture, and religion.\n\n\nIntroduction\nOne of the focal tenets of Islamophobic discourse is the essentialization of Muslims as a homogeneous entity, with no respect for their ethnocultural, national, historic, or theological complexity. 1 Gender issues specifically women related issues in Pakistan primarily revolve around significant exposure to a quality education, health care services, work environment and employment protections, governmental involvement (women have always been a part of the process, but not as authors of laws and codes), and, more widely, overlap with challenges centered on citizen status, radical social and religious movement patterns, individuals basic rights, linguistic discourses, military interventions, regional violence, economic hardship, civil liberties, and social perceptions. 2 In general, the women's liberation movement has been active in terms of research generation, concerning it's organizational work supplying the majority of the discourse analysis that serves as the foundation for knowledge production concerning gender in Pakistan. 3 In contrast their focus remains on religion and gender instead of culture, society and gender. It further promotes to Islamophobic attitudes. The most common feature among Western societies and media is that one can always witness Islamophobic tendencies in them; and the occurrences recurring repetitively to such an extent that they are not something new to observe by Muslims around the globe. Notwithstanding this evident hostility for Muslim community, there appears to be a persistent progressive concern for Muslim women, which may not be for their independence from patriarchal structures or an allegedly oppressive faith. It is more of a goal of transforming Muslim cultures into Westernization and isolating Muslims from religious values, which ultimately promotes colonial involvement and dominance. 4 Aurat March (Women march) is a Pakistani human rights campaign started by the common people, which is primarily made up of females and marginalized communities including minorities, hermaphrodites, and queers. Young progressive activists launched the inaugural Aurat March (Women's March) as a protest movement motivated by the worldwide #MeToo movement in 2018, but by the subsequent year, campaigning against sexual harassment had risen in numbers and geographical distribution. 5 The year 2018 marks the beginning of this women activism, and by the year 2022, the activity have become a national depiction of women rights event for the month of March. Feminists consider the Aurat March as a vehicle for bringing women's problems to the forefront of political, legislative, social, and media debate. 6 The present research specifically addresses the Gendered-Islamophobia in context of religion, Aurat March (Women March) and Pakistani society. It specifically focuses that how these marches intentionally or unintentionally playing a role in spreading gendered Islamophobia under the umbrella of 'women rights. The present study highlights that how the constructed stereotypical image of women in Western societies is now upheld by elite women living in Muslim societies through these marches.\n\nAbstracting Gendered Islamophobia\nGender issues in Islamic perspective are discussed as part of the academic subjects. It not only focuses on gender issues, but it also generates misconceptions and stereotyped images of women in Islamic civilizations. According to some, the depiction of Muslim women and the discourse over equal liberation in Islam have always been at the top of the agenda of 'a cultural battle between the West and the Muslim world, as these two religious/civilizational blocks share a long history of hostility' in the form of clashes, colonial intervention strategies, and prolonged dehumanization (ideologically). 7 Gender based violence and gendered injustice specifically towards Muslim women now can be noticed around the world without stating Muslim or non-Muslim countries.\nIslamophobia, literally \"fear of Islam,\" is in fact 'a spectrum of political positions and ideological strategies that are aimed at generating or increasing fear, hatred, and distrust' towards Muslims and Islam. 8 Conceptually, Islamophobia is neither realized nor understood in terms of its 4 Md. Mahmudul Hassan, \"Feminism as Islamophobia: A Review of Misogyny Charges against Islam,\" Intellectual Discourse 20, no. 1 (2012): 55-78. 5 Afiya Shehrbano Zia, \"Performing piety and sexuality in Pakistan,\" From Terrorism to Television, (Routledge: India, 2020), 113. consistency and rationality. 9 Gendered Islamophobia may be defined as ethno-religious and racist prejudice against Muslim women that proceed from historically contextualized negative stereotypes that \"inform individual and systemic forms of oppression.\" 10 The extant definitions of Islamophobia point to some negative sentiment (usually on the part of non-Muslims, ) towards Muslims or Islam. 11 Muslim women come from a wide range of cultural and racial backgrounds; have a wide range of political views; and hold values ranging from uncompromising liberalism to religious rigidity. Having said that, a diverse range of Muslim women frequently face comparable unpleasant experiences as a result of being unjustly portrayed as timid, helpless, repressed, or prone to violence. 12 The term Islamophobia in current times is continuously being used to apprehend extensively misconceptions and negative portrayals of Muslims and Islam. 13 Muslim women, in particular, have been depicted woefully in societal conceptualizations by the liberal Muslim women literature and contemporary Western women's rights outsets.\nGiven the contemporary discourse, it is not unexpected that many intellectuals and activists felt need to defend their cultural identity. They believe it is necessary to provide a more advanced picture of Muslim societies, one that acknowledges women identity and their contributions to society. At the very least, many activists and academics do not want to propagate harmful perceptions by disclosing destructive information. 14 The reason is far from ambiguities as it is also not surprising many activitists actively working vice versa. For them, it costs nothing to defame women, religion, and social structures for the sake of publicity and fake recognition, forgetting that how a minor inattention can be an additional certificate in the world of Islamophobia and an increase in international narratives against Muslims, Islam, and Pakistani society.\nUnfortunately, the global response to the September 11 th ,2001 case has turned the world, particularly the Western world, against Islam, Muslims, and Islamic Societies. It fostered distrust in the Muslim communities; and induced attitudes of fear, mistrust, and insecurity in all Muslims residing in Western cultures. 15 Either it is individual or a community, institutions or an organization while promoting numerous types of racism, discrimination, hatred, classicism, prejudice, bigotry, and the portrayals of Muslim women's image must endure in rational limitations. These interpretations can lead either constructive if productive or destructive effects on the entire structure of any society. The representation of women without proper investigation as victims, suppressed, subordinated, and discriminated typically marks the stereotypical composition of Muslim women in  Abu-Zayd Nasr, \"Religions: From Phobia to Understanding,\" Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge 8, no. 2 (2010): 5-20, 9. general and Muslim societies in particular. The immediate consequence can lead towards Muslim males as suppressers and Islam as xenophobic religion that in factual form is far from truth.\n\nThe Origin of Secular Women Elites and Feminism in Pakistan\nSince the modern notion of \"human Rights\" originated in Western secular context, Muslims in general and Muslim women in particular find themselves in dilemma when they participate or initiate in any discussion concerning human rights either in Western or Muslim countries. 16 Western civilization has been an eager advocate of liberating Muslim women in terms of improving their perceived condition by fighting the ḥijāb and pressing on their sufferings. In the guise of freedom and feminism, however, this progressive Western fascination converted woman into a mere product. 17 During the Western women's liberation movement of the 1960's and 1970's, the word \"liberated\" lost much of its authentic meaning. It ended up meaning morally free. Women mistakenly thought being liberated meant freedom from traditional moral guidelines and virtuous lifestyles. 18 Modernism had an impact not just on Western European countries, but also on Islamic states with majority Muslim's residents. This recent phenomenon has aided in the cultivation of a negative image of Islam as a primitive, strict, and conservative faith, which has caused and making a significant contribution to the deterioration of Muslim people and the Islamic community. The set image is not presented by non-Muslim scholars and critics only. A major portion of Muslim feminists, activists, some of secular social scholars and westernized Muslims elites are nonetheless equally responsible.\nThe role of secular women elites in modernizing the Pakistani society is evident and cannot be denied. A very clear picture depicting the role of women since the emergence of Pakistan is selfevident. The involvement of upper-class women began with political representation and has since expanded to the social, judicial, and industrial arenas in the framework of empowering women and making them financially independent in society. Historically, the emphasis was on the causes that contributed to the restriction of women's participation in any field while modernizing the society. 19 From the very initial stage of nation building to current date, these elite forces tried hard to bring their own kind of philosophies and women's rights that better served their very own interests neglecting the choice of majority.\nThis notion is also predicated on the idea that modernism is an autonomous and complete creation of European brilliance, owing nothing to the non-European world. Postcolonial structures and Westernized secular elites in the periphery have typically been immersed in these trappings, which dehistoricize world history as single and one-dimensional. From the fifteenth through the twentieth centuries, the marginalized communities are perceived via the societal structures, ideas, interpretations, consequences, and constructions of European colonization of the non-European globe. 20 Simultaneously, it is often portrayed by several activists of human rights that in both non- Western (including many Muslims) and Western societies, the existence of human rights is possible only in the context of secularism and not in frame of religion. 21 It is to be recognized that the Pakistan Movement was founded and launched by Europeaneducated Muslim secular elites, originating from feudal, business, and professional classes. 22 Much of the literature has been produced by many of the women right's activists and researchers through their work on the issues of secularism, religious limitations, women rights and women activism in Pakistan since the origin of Pakistan. Considerable part of the work further highlights the time period of Zia ul Haq and women's beginning of resistance during 1980s. 23 The women rights activism begun as reformations of certain rights to modern street activism during 80s; and then in 21 st century continued as modern street/social media. It took seventy-four years consisting of silence, street slogans and social media platform struggles to validate the rights and responsibilities in terms of modernizing Pakistani women.\nThe traditional group's uncontested assumption maintains that feminism in Pakistan is an elite ideology founded by elitist women. They argue that the feminist movement as a whole is deceptive in the context of Pakistan owing to the nature of the challenges that the country is experiencing. The movement is routinely condemned for failing to address or include the issues of Pakistan's poverty stricken, disadvantaged, illiterate women. Women's liberation, according to the religious right, ought to be a priority for the campaigners. 24 On February 12, 1983, Women in Pakistan marched to the streets for the first time to protest against 'Hudood Ordinance' and according to them politicization of Islam. Protest movements and demonstrations were outlawed under Pakistan's Criminal Code at the period, yet roughly 200 women protestors in Lahore publicly challenged the military authority. Because of these women endeavors, Pakistan nowadays marks a 'National Women's Day' to honor the events of that day. 25 Basically, the era of Zia ul Haq and the program of Islamization was the earliest time period when women have actively come out to resist and demand repealing of laws initiated by the government. The laws related to women and gender were considered as anti-women and a way to control women's emancipation in context of religion and social structures. This was the time when resistance to religious laws was notice perfectly. Although, the birth of secular laws and approaches was not new to this region but they have started enforcement of more secular laws since 1960s. This made them to resist Islamic laws and modify them with modern laws.\nReligions that are perceived as anti-modern and illogical must be forgotten if civilization is to be restructured and modernized. Although these secular elites are scattered throughout numerous social systems and sectors, their social standing, educational qualifications, and economic class are  strongly intertwined to hierarchies, and so they are regarded as 'power elites'. Within Pakistan, like other underdeveloped nations, these secular elites are structurally and socially diverse and marked by dynamism that aims to establish a social space for the voicing of public demands and challenges to the state's monopolizing authority. 26 At certain points, these modern forces tried hard and remained successful in fulfilling their desires by changing the laws of the country.\nYet another particularly efficient tactic of hitting Muslims was to sensationalize the issue of Muslim women. Muslim women and Islamic belief systems are mainstreamed by feminist universalist assumptions, which tends to build global identity from East to West. 27 The existing skepticism refers to progressive authoritarianism, colonial supremacy, and traditionalism. Their opinions and attitudes regarding Islam and Muslims in particular are shaped by stereotypes, irrational beliefs, and emotional prejudice. As a result, in certain settings, they would come to associate Islam with religious fundamentalism, fanaticism, radicalism, and extremism. 28 Presenting Islam as inherently oppressing religion and Muslim women as oppressed is not something new after 9/11 incident. It continued to exist in different ways. In fact, nowadays its propagation through the means of internet and media the intensity in these stereotypes is worth noticeable.\n\nAurat March and Gendered Islamophobia\nFeminists in Islamic traditional societies do not consider sharing an \"Enlightenment\" or \"progressive interpretive Islāmic view\"; conversely, they are even more tending to question the interconnection between cultural and religiously based power constructions. In Pakistan, secular and democratic ideologies usually point to major social changes in context of social interactions. 29 In Muslim societies, secular feminists encourage liberal advocacy and examine the interrelationship of social and judicial elements to determine women's standing. 30 Local culture, religious values and social structures of native by modernized elite class are disregarded as old ancient oppressive values. Aurat March is a tragic result of colonialism that has shifted some women of the state to focus from religious and familial values to self-interest in the name of modernity.\nLooking at the word Islamophobia in context of the Pakistani society, it may be defined as respectable and informed implicit Islamophobia, which is founded on several identical conceptions that modern secular Islamophobes in Western contexts explore. It tries to justify a claimed Islamist menace by building them as \"folk devils, causing moral panic,\" as a result of the currently prevailing West-centric global power structure. 31 Many feminist observants of Muslim societies prefer secular feminisms' discourses by entitling Islam as \"misogynistic and gender oppressive.\" 32 As a result, it represents the elites' efforts to reject the genuinely needed potential frameworks in democracy, as well as the importance of religion in shaping societal cultural boundaries. A simple look at Muslim countries across the world, such as Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Uzbekistan, 26 Shah, \"Post-coloniality, Islamization and Secular Elites: Tracing Islamophobia in Pakistan,\" 66. 27 Hassan, \"Feminism as Islamophobia: A Review of Misogyny Charges against Islam,\" 59. 28 Shah, \"Post-coloniality, Islamization and Secular elites: Tracing Islamophobia in Pakistan,\" 67. illustrates this. This may sound counterintuitive, yet it is vividly present among the Muslim majority environments inside postcolonial episteme. 33 Many spread negativity and biased discourses against Islamic teachings without acknowledging that what kind of damage they are bringing to the Muslim Ummah.\nEssentially, the movement is known as the Aurat March that has been stated in March, 2018 by different communities. According to its organizers, the Aurat March represented all ideas of feminism: liberals seeking personal liberties, welfare, and legal protections; radical feminists looking to break free from patriarchs; and socialists seeking independence from capitalism and patriarchy. The activists' question why their demands for racial equality, an ending to gender-based abuse, prejudice, and subordination are considered unnecessary, while also addressing the issues like that as body politics, forced conversions and weddings, and access to public areas. 34 The initiative attempted to raise awareness about the barriers to justice that women suffer in Pakistani society overall, however, the protesters brought another debate frontline. The Aurat March spawned many controversial placards by its participants that steered it towards another discussion taking it out from \"rights\" to \"frights\". As an alternative, creating an impact and brining positive change for woman who suffers at true verge, it caused another challenging moment whether to acknowledge or repel it outrightly. One of the major challenges was striking the religious limitations, social values, and cultural structures of Pakistani society.\nIt has been claimed that the chaotic environment and discourses within which feminists' subjects arise to organize around women's emancipation is plagued with the ultimate deception of these concerns as Westerners. It has never been more obvious that these ultimate narratives offer themselves so naturally to the manipulation and organizing of collective anti-feminist sentiments than in these days of empire-building, conflicts, and Islamophobia. 35 The depiction is not as simple as it has been shown here. The reason is not their enthusiastic \"women's rights work,\" but rather their superfluous, unclear, and unproductive work that has no room in any civilized culture. The marginalized group is unaware of their voices, magical struggle and work. On the other hand, th collective struggle and resistance are not directed against feminism or women's rights, but against its Islamophobic nature. As nation passionately waits for them to stand up and fight against Gendered Islamophobia, instead playing a role vice versa.\nDue to the results of numerous internal and external factors, Pakistani society is currently increasingly polarized in terms of religious, ideological, and political lines. These includes but are not limited to colonial implications and their patterned post-colonial history and politics; growing religionization of politics; the country's revival of Islamism; and longstanding external conflicts regarding Kashmir and Afghanistan at another end. 36 On the other hand, it has been considered that Aurat March was groundbreaking in its outspokenness; chants were sung condemning violence against women and demanding a stop to the assaults. The opponents lost little time in arguing that women's autonomy could not exist in Pakistani society since Pakistani values, customs, and religious beliefs are built on women's seclusion. 37 The social structures and religious beliefs are not 33 Shah, \"Post-coloniality, Islamization and Secular elites: Tracing Islamophobia in Pakistan,\" 61. 34 Batool and Malik, \"Bringing the Focus Back: Aurat March and the Regeneration of Feminism in Pakistan,\" 320. 35 Charania, \"Feminism, Sexuality and the Rhetoric of Westernization in Pakistan,\" 329. 36 Shah, \"Post-coloniality, Islamization and Secular elites: Tracing Islamophobia in Pakistan,\" 66. 37 Batool and Malik, \"Bringing the Focus Back: Aurat March and the Regeneration of Feminism in Pakistan,\" 322.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT AND CIVILIZATION\nVolume 12 Issue 2, Fall 2022 easy to challenge in state where majority doesn't accept irrational philosophies brought by 'interest groups' just to fulfill some of their aspirations.\nIslamic order is perceived as a homogenous, brutal, and archaic and inferior societal order in comparison to Western world. Subsequently, it has been claimed that it does encourage extremism and promotes violence. Islamophobia is defined here as a cognitive and emotional manifestation of broad hostility toward Islam as a stigmatized religious system, as well as a stereotyped out-group phenomenon directed at allegedly practicing Muslims. 38 Religion is not a disease as some neo liberals claim. 39 Let's for a while, set back Pakistani society's values and traditions. There is no questioning that certain Islamophobic mindset exists in Muslim states, as represented by a \"Westernized postcolonial secular elite\", which is rooted in European critiques of religious doctrine during the Enlightenment and modern worldwide discourse of \"religious radicalism.\" 40 Pakistan is a largest Muslim populated country where women can be head of state, religious scholars, army officers, flying officers, doctors, educationists, bureaucrats, running offices and homes being mothers as well. A country where women run states and houses is still considered and portrayed as a country where females are treated as \"second citizens\" is seems to be unjust. This is nothing but to create a disheartened nature of Islam and Pakistani nation towards gender and to present it in front of the world who are unable to experience the reality.\n\nAcceptance and Resistance to the Aurat March\nThe Islamic republic of Pakistan resides Muslim majority; and only a smaller, but significant, group in society conforms to Islamophobic trends. These liberal power elites hold comparable anti-Islamic views, which are founded in traditional Western ideologies of secularism and modernization. Furthermore, the present rise of political Islamism and its association with violence stigmatizes the religion as a whole, which is entrenched in local cultural traditions and social norms. 41 The current women rights movement in Pakistan has reclaimed its focus, which was perhaps lost throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Although it addressed a few significant concerns at the time, the movement stayed passive on many women actual concerns, and when it did speak out, backing for those stances was insufficient. As a result, the movement's haphazard efforts to address topics such as right to bodily autonomy, sexuality, LGBTQs concerns, private patriarchy and division of labor, and so on were ineffective in the 1990s. 42 Islam, which is practiced among an overwhelming majority of the population, has come to be seen as a menace by a small minority of secular elites who exhibit currents of 'implicit', 'respectable' and 'enlightened' Islamophobia, which can be understood as 'discursive' manifestations of the phenomenon. 43 It has been argued that a prolonged feminist's advocacy has never been generally supported by \"political developments\" throughout the entire set-ups in Pakistan. 44 Since Aurat March inception, the challenging slogans against societal dominant norms and gender roles have been thoroughly analyzed by different academic scholars due to public 38 Shah, \"Post-coloniality, Islamization and Secular: Tracing Islamophobia in Pakistan,\" 66. 39 Nasr, \"Religions: From Phobia to Understanding,\" 9. 40 Shah, \"Post-coloniality, Islamization and secular elites: Tracing Islamophobia in Pakistan,\" 61. Advocacy via street protests and demonstrations, the movement began with thousands of women marching across Pakistani cities, holding slogans and placards that, from one viewpoint, intended to advocate women's rights while from another perspective, provoking controversies openly. 47 The stronger and remarkable backlash brought by current Aurat March has no comparison to the earlier women's rights activism in Pakistan. Majorly, this march has turned as \"selective Aurat March\" by not representing the true issues of all women living in Pakistan. They became vocal to vague issues that better suited to their inherent agendas. The placards most of the participants holding were more humorous, non-serious, illogical that gained popularity in media and social networks. They almost converted it to a politically backed agenda. Basically, they forgot making it sanitized and comfortable for all women but just to cater their own specific causes. Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi, Special Representative to the Prime Minister on Religious Harmony, warned during a press briefing, while saying; \"Those who brought disgrace to religion by raising anti-religious slogans and displaying objectionable placards at the Aurat March would not be spared and action would be taken against them under the law. He said freedom of speech was not meant to insult the religious beliefs. Such people wanted anarchy in the country and nothing else.\" 48 The majority of Pakistani people are highly concerned about their traditions and cultural values. In case of the Aurat March through electronic and social media, one would come across numerous reactions simply detesting Aurat March. It saw more resentment from public, condemnation from assembly members and especially from the people who are more attached to family values and cultural traditions. 49 In a research study, it has been analyzed that the March slogans were vulgar, immodest, and contrary to Muslims and Pakistani cultural norms. The chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) stressed the pivotal importance of examining these slogans and determining if either Islamic or family values are in danger of collapsing. 50 The business and publicity approach are very much visible through these enchanted selective slogans. We clearly need to recognize the incoming danger whose target is not the actual issues but the core values of a civilized society.\nDuring a hearing, chief Justice expressed annoyance over the slogans displayed on the placards and banners by the march organizers and observed that it was not cleared that on whose agenda such events were held. 51 Even they have seen much criticism from self-feminists, actors and many other women rights activists, e.g., Kishwar Naheed (a renowned feminist poetess of Pakistan) stated by 45  https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/801928-not-to-spare-those-who-disgraced-religion-ataurat-march-ashrafi, 49 Khushbakht, and Munazza Sultana, \"The Women Activism in Pakistan: An Analysis of Aurat March,\" 68. It is illustrated that events like \"Women March 2018 and Women on Bikes prove women's resistance, and that progress is taking place, but it surely is slow by eliminating religious and cultural impediments to advocate justice and equality for women.\" 53 Many of the placards clearly targets Islam, Muslim women being oppressed and perhaps suggest a hidden link between Islam, Muslims and oppression. These young women brought religion, women and gendered Islamophobia not in streets but publicized it at international level through media means including social and electronic media. Some of the noticeable posters including but not limited to are: \"Oppressors are still the same, men, mullah and military,\" \"Tumhary tashaddud karnay pe konse mulk ka khuda khush hota hai? (Which country's God gets happy just because of your extreme violence?) Maa behn ku maarta mujh per Islam jharhta (You beat mother and sister while imposing Islam on me) I have no sharam and if you find my sharam, keep it. (I have no Shame and if you find my Shame, keep it), Main 9 sal ki the wo 50 sal ka. Mjhy chup karwa dia gya aur us ki awaz aaj be masjid main gonjti hai (I was nine years old; he was fifty years old. They made me silent, and his voice still echoes in Mosque). Islam nain tou haqooq de diye musalman kab de ga? (Islam has given the rights, when Muslims will?), hum la'ain gay inqilab, bin dhaarhi Karl Marx (We will bring revolution, without bearded Karl Marx). It has been argued that 'the stereotypical and one-dimensional image of the Muslim woman as oppressed, unaware of rights, completely subordinate, and really no more than a shadowy figure peering from behind the veil, and the corresponding image of the Muslim man as the oppressor, as backward, premodern, evil, and antiwoman, people in Muslim countries, including activists, have been placed on the self-justifying plinth.' 54 Of course, Islamophobia directed at Muslim men is also gendered, and depictions of violent, intimidating, and cruel Muslim males have joined the same set of tools for propagating Islamophobia that frequently highlights Muslim women as subjugated and repressed by those men. The thing is gender should not be limited to Muslim women's bodies as a category of analysis. 55 The unfavorable portrayal of the \"Islamic East\" depicts Muslim women as requiring help from the enlightened West to achieve independence from patriarchal society. As a result, the adoption of Radical feminist ideas based upon Westernization and notions of women's rights into Muslim countries is promoted. 56 The promotion of these depicted stories is alarming for Muslim values around the world. It significantly added fuel to the fire. The cost of these activities and sponsorships are exceptionally intense that Muslim Ummah has borne and continuously paying for it. In a study, the researcher Afshan Jafar has been responded by Razia, an older female, and a longtime NGO activist to her interview question: \"don't use your women to get a buck, or get yourself projected outside. I mean you are sort of cleaning your dirty linen outside, that's not what the women of Pakistan want. Women of Pakistan want you to change the existing reality here!\" 57 Many NGOs who are furthering their campaigns are dreadfully connected with spreading misinformation and specific purposes. These distorted behaviors are not only released by public but 52 Sadia Khatri, \"Should Feminists Claim Aurat March's 'Vulgar' Posters? Yes, Absolutely,\" Dawn News, March 19, 2019, https://www.dawn.com/news/1469815 53 Anjum, \"Women's Activism in Pakistan: Role of Religious Nationalism and Feminist Ideology Among Self-Identified Conservatives and Liberals,\" 39. 54 Afshan Jafar, Women's NGOs in Pakistan. (Springer, 2016), 64. 55 Hammer, \"(Muslim) Women's Bodies, Islamophobia, and American politics,\" 29. 56 Hassan, \"Feminism as Islamophobia: A Review of Misogyny Charges against Islam,\" 59.  (No womb No opinion), Shadi k ilawa aur be both kaam hain (there are many other things to do besides getting married), Divorced and happy, Get your laws off my body, Mawari hai tou tum ho mawari se sharam kesi? (Period necessitates your existence then why to feel ashamed of periods). Consistent with their past record, women from the Minhajul Qur'ān and the Jamaat-e-Islami outrightly condemned and grieved at the International Women's Day Aurat March event that otherwise historically the Jamaat's women wing has always embraced in its own framing of women's rights. Furthermore, under the spurious objections to indecency, it was stated that the far more significant reaction to the Aurat March was because it put gender and sexual liberties on the agenda setting. 58 The complications are not with the storylines, but the multiple meanings associated with it. The former Nazim of Jamiat Talaba-e-Islam and member of Jamat-e-Islami disapproved of Aurat March and contended that slogans raised by a \"few shameless women\" do not represent women living in an Islamic society. 59 By using, \"We women\", \"Pakistani women\" or \"Muslim women\" as a single standardized oppressed object who do not have any bodily right is basically injustice to the entire Muslim women citizens around the world.\nFurthermore, it has been illustrated that these posters were striking reflections of Pakistan's culturally entrenched religio-cultural patriarchal supremacy, which is zealously safeguarded. The majority of these problematic banners were questioning male ideals of decency and gender discrimination, and some even featured LGBTQs political refrains, which was unheard in Pakistan's public discourse. 60 It has been considered that these slogans were a way forward for sexual freedom and by brining sexuality related issues onto streets will resolve their existing problems. These were very challenging to social and religious norms concerning the most important institution of Islam i.e., marriage.\nWhat we usually notice at other human rights' demonstrations, this event's placards were more unreasonable and quite entertaining. One provoking a social media backlash should have been unobjectionable: it read, \"heat your own food.\" In 2019, large marches were held in several major cities. A handful of even more provocative placards (\"warm your own bed,\" \"keep dic [sic] pics to yourself,\" an image of a woman sitting open legged saying, \"Now I'm seated appropriately\") provoked a misogynist fury condemnation from assemblies and religious institutions. 61 However, it has been claimed that, \"In a country like Pakistan, where dogma is largely influenced by religion, progressive movements like the Aurat March are not particularly well received by religious scholars and politically conservative groups, who decry the March's demands and civil disobedience as \"un-Islamic.\" 62 Such kind of irrationality in the name of modernity has no place in practicing Muslim societies. A Muslim majority country has to be religious in terms of their practices, norms and values. What else it could be? Paradoxically, neither Muslim nor Pakistanis were against women rights. They just wanted to come out of turning serious issues into an entertaining one. For example, Lo baith gai sahih se (Now I am seated correctly), Cynthia karay tou shabash main karun tou badmash (If Cynthia does, she's applauded, If I do it, I am a rogue). Main awara main badchalan (I am Gallivanted, I am Depraved), Agar dupatta itna pasand hai tou apni ankhun pe bandh lu (If you like the headscarf that 58 Zia, \"Performing Piety and Sexuality in Pakistan,\" 112. 59 Batool and Malik, \"Bringing the Focus Back: Aurat March and the Regeneration of Feminism in Pakistan,\" 325. 60 Zia, \"Performing piety and sexuality in Pakistan,\" 112. much then wrap it around your eyes), Akeli, Awara, Azaad (Alone, Wanderer, Free). While analyzing these, no one is going consider these demands as \"women rights\". It is not about misogynists or patriarchy, it is not about religion or culture for a while, it is not about conservatism or modernism. Rationally, it is about what influenced them to make these odd demands that neither comes in rights nor portrays civil liberties by displaying un-Islamic and obscene posters.\n\nConclusion\nIslam from its very initial stage has developed ideological foundation. The rights that are granted to Western women in nineteenth century has been given to Muslim women fourteen hundred years ago without any march and rallies. The research shows that modern elites and secular liberals sees Islam and Islamic teachings as a 'threat' to secular agendas, in general; and to elite modern women in specific. The representation of Islamic societies as a whole oppressive, violent, fanatic and intolerant in context of women rights is nothing but a fake publicity stunt. It is an obvious disregard to teachings of Islam and social norms framed by elites' seculars backed by Western's ideologies that has nothing to do with religiosity. The negativities they are blaming towards Islamic culture is filled with Islamophobic trends. Islamophobia is not a myth now... The image of the country where many of women living, safe and secure life cannot be swapped by some examples and stereotypes association.\nActivists of Aurat March in Pakistan, focused the issues concerning nonparticipation of women in public sector, tyranny at homes, subjugation by marriage, patriarchy and many more things. Males are portrayed as oppressors. Although Pakistan is country where a woman can even serve as Prime Minister e.g., Benazir Bhuttu), foreign minister, speaker assembly (Fehmida Mirza) as a bureaucrat, running businesses and corporates and many more professions in lists without any gender discrimination. Aurat March's biased representation of Muslim women lives construction could be either limiting or destructive for Muslim women around the world. The impact of these events may lead to rise in negative attitudes and scattered stereotypes. These specific representations can harm the choices of majority and can be an additional certificate in the world of Islamophobia and an increase in international narratives against Muslims, Islam, and Pakistani society. These posters and activities of Aurat March, inspired by global women's rights movements and secular modern trends transmit Islamophobic stereotypes towards Islam, Muslim women in general and Pakistan in specific context. The paper concludes by analyzing the important insights to counter the gendered Islamophobia in the lives of Muslim women while limiting themselves into gender, culture, and religion. There should be some restrictions and limitations for such marches by the government and legal institutions."

              "A Framework to Assess the Supports Provided for Muslim Students in a Public School\n\nMany studies and surveys show that Islam is a misunderstood religion in many areas of the world. Therefore, Muslims in the West are a “poorly understood” minority group (Environics Institute, 2016). While other ethnic or racial minorities feel moderately comfortable defending themselves, their groups, and asserting their identities, Muslim youth “face qualitatively different identity tasks than do many of their peers,” largely due to feelings of “being under attack or scrutiny because of their religion” (Stonebanks & Sensoy, 2009). The purpose of this article is to present a framework that educators and administrators can use to identify the current supports provided for Muslim students and the gaps in what is available to help Muslim students feel welcomed in their schools. The framework is a two-dimensional matrix with six major challenges that Muslim students experience and the corresponding supports utilizing Banks’ Five Multicultural Dimensions (Content Integration, Knowledge Construction, Equity Pedagogy, Prejudice Reduction, Empowering School Culture and School Structures). The six challenges most prominently faced by Muslim youth, as articulated in the literature review and documents provided by school boards on the guidelines for different faith-groups are: religious practices, dress code, sexual ethics, stereotypes and biases, Islamophobia, and curriculum-related challenges.\n\nMuslims, in general, worry about visually and verbally self-identifying out of fear of facing discrimination, assault, prejudice, and disrespect. 1 Muslims, including students who outwardly identify as Muslims or who adhere to Islamic guidelines and practices, face specific challenges for which they may require support from their schools. 2 Islam and Muslims are perceived as strange and different by over 50% of the population. 3 Nonetheless, Muslims continue to observe their religious practices and identify as Muslims despite facing unique challenges: Muslims are one of the most religiously observant groups in Canada, and their religious identities and practices appear to be strengthening rather than weakening as their lives evolve in Canada. Being Muslim is a very important part of the identity for most followers of Islam. 4 Muslim youth who want to practice their faith in schools (e.g., wear Hijab, pray five times a day, wear looser clothes during gym classes, etc.) face numerous challenges directly from administrators and teachers, but also indirectly from their peers. 5 Misconceptions about Islam held by teachers exacerbate Muslim youths' anxiety about practicing their faith and identifying outwardly as Muslims. 6 The obvious \"difference\" visible to others observing Muslims in prayer or other forms of worship contributes to Muslim students' feelings of alienation and selfconsciousness. 7 Researchers maintain that those defined as \"different\" usually find it difficult to gain access to opportunities and resources available to the majority. 8 For the purposes of this article, I will be using Ontario as an example and the documents of the Ontario Ministry of Education. Policies and procedures in Ontario public schools require school administrators and teachers to \"ensure equity\" for all of their students. 9 Equity, according to Ontario's Equity and Inclusive Education Strategy is \"a condition or state of fair, inclusive, and respectful treatment of all people,\" 10 meaning that everyone has fair access to knowledge and learning. In order for Muslim students to have \"fair, inclusive and respectful treatment,\" they need supports. The purpose of this article is to present a framework as a tool for educators and administrators to identify the current supports provided for Muslim students and the gaps for what is needed to help Muslim students feel welcomed in their respective schools.\n\nConceptual Framework\nThe conceptual framework (Table 1) is a two-dimensional matrix representing the five dimensions of Banks' multicultural education 11 and the common struggles and challenges that Muslim students face in schools, adapted from the literature. 12 I often hear teachers and administrators wondering how they can support Muslim students and genuinely exploring ways to provide a sense of belonging for their Muslim students. In my research, as well as my conversations with principals, when I ask about schools' current supports for Muslim students, I am always directed to the board's religious accommodation procedures and the Ontario Human Rights Commissions' (OHRC) Policy Statements on religious accommodations in schools. Only two of the challenges identified in the matrix (religious practice and dress code) align with the accommodation procedures used by the boards. Furthermore, the procedures do not provide a description, an explanation, or even a context to the challenges, and, therefore, it becomes a mechanical and logistical procedure that is checked off on principals' annual reports regarding religious accommodations under equity and inclusive practices. This article provides some depth and insight into the challenges faced by Muslim students and corresponding supports. I also elaborate briefly on the issues with the word \"accommodations\" under the section defining \"supports.\" The conceptual framework shown in Table 1 offers a \"graphic organizer,\" a term used in education for a visual tool that educators use to organize ideas, to help administrators and teachers assess the supports, or lack thereof, for Muslim students, specifically with respect to their unique challenges. Each cell in the table provides space to record observations, conversations, or artifacts as evidence of the supports in the school. In the segment below, I will briefly provide an example of how this conceptual framework can be used as a tool for educators to identify and provide supports for Muslim students.\n\nAn Example of How to Use the Conceptual Framework\nThe framework can be used as a tool to identify the supports that are in place in a school setting, as well as a way to conduct a systematic needs assessment to identify gaps. Educators who choose to use this tool can interview teachers, parents, and students to get a broad overview of supports and gaps. For example, some questions that they can ask the Muslim students in their schools are: • Can you tell me about your experiences as a student in this school? • What do you think the challenges are for Muslim youth/students today? • How do you feel about attending this school? (This question relates specifically to the school culture.) • Why do you feel the way you feel in your school? Do you see yourself represented in the curriculum of specific classes? Do you relate to the curriculum? Some examples of probing questions: • Do you feel supported and understood in the school?\n• Are there special programs or practices in this school that you feel are supporting (or not supporting) you? Why or why not? Are you aware of any supports, affordances or constraints provided by the programs?\nOther ways to carry out a needs assessment is to ask direct questions related to Islamophobia or curriculum related challenges students might be having due to being Muslim. In the next segment, I first define the concepts \"Muslim,\" and \"challenge,\" and then explore what is meant by the word \"support\" in the context of education and Ontario Ministry of Education documents. Discussion of the main support systems follows, and finally, a representation of how these are connected is shown within the conceptual framework.\n\nDefining Muslim\nI start with answering the question \"who is a Muslim?\" This is important so that administrators can support their Muslim students. This discussion could easily get very complex, but for the purposes of this article, I define some basic criteria as a foundation of knowledge by which we can avoid confusion.\n\nDefining 'Muslim' and 'Visible Muslim'\nThe legal definition of a Muslim, according to Islamic jurisprudence, is anyone who believes that \"there is no God but God, and Muhammad is his final prophet.\" This belief in Islam is called the Shahada or the declaration of faith. However, for the purposes of this article, anyone who identifies himself or herself as Muslim is considered to be a Muslim. This may include, but is not limited to, Muslims who are born to Muslim parents and believe in the declaration of faith but choose not to practice some or all the five pillars and Muslims who are born to Muslim parents and do not believe in the declaration of faith or practice the five pillars, or individuals who are not born to Muslim families but identify as Muslims. Therefore, just like in any faith group, a Muslim is someone who identifies as one, and there is a wide range of ways of expressing Muslim-ness.\nMuslim students are not all the same. The inherent universality of Islam necessitates diversity across its practitioners, meaning that Muslims are not expected to look, dress, behave, eat, and conduct their lives like one another; that would be unrealistic and absurd. Just because one is a Muslim does not mean anything is known about them. In this changing world, with varying climates, terrains, agriculture, histories, and cultures, how one lives requires a variety of interpretations and consideration of the \"plurality of cultures.\" Even though almost a quarter of the world's population identify as Muslim, Islam is a religion comprised of a variety of cultures and civilizations. 13 \"Visible\" Muslims are those who can be identified as Muslims because of their dress (wearing the Hijab, kufi, niqab, thawb) 14 , by the way they wear their beard with a trimmed moustache, or how 13 Asma Ahmed, Exploring the Experiences of Muslim Students in an Urban Ontario Public School (PhD diss., University of Western Ontario, 2016). 14 A kufi is a kind of a hat Muslim males choose to wear. A thawb is a kind of long male dress that men wear. A shilwar kamez is a long shirt (or man-dress) and loose pants that men wear mostly from South Asian countries. A niqab is a veil Muslim women choose to wear to cover their face. they overtly practice their faith (e.g., they pray anywhere -in malls, on the street, in public parks, in restaurants; they let others know they are fasting).\n\nDefining Challenge\nThe word \"challenge\" is used in this article frequently. The definition of \"challenge\" varies depending on how it is used in a sentence. In this article, and in Ontario Ministry of Education documents, the word \"challenge\" and \"challenges\" as nouns usually refer to \"difficulty/difficulties.\" The reason why the word \"difficulty\" is not used in ministry documents is because of its negative connotation. \"Challenge,\" on the other hand, connotes a difficulty or a problem that can be overcome. When I present the challenges faced by Muslim students in the conceptual framework, I mainly use the word to mean the difficulties that Muslim students face in their respective public schools-as adopted from literature in the field-which is mainly experienced by those who adhere to the Islamic faith. I explain those difficulties in detail toward the end of this chapter.\n\nDefining Support\nBefore I explore the concept of \"support\" in this article and how it is used in Ministry of Education documents, I would like to briefly discuss equity and inclusion. Initially, I chose the term \"accommodate\" instead of \"support\" when I initiated this research proposal. Over time, however, I realized the limitations of the word \"accommodate.\" Specifically, \"accommodation\" in the curriculum documents refers to assessment accommodations that allow pupils \"to participate in the curriculum and to demonstrate achievement of expectations. 15 These accommodations may include \"visual supports to clarify verbal instructions, assistive technology, or some form of human support.\" 16 The Ontario Human Rights Code (OHRC) provides the \"duty to accommodate,\" which refers to \"changing a rule or making an exception to all or part of it for the person concerned.\" 17 Muslim students in the public school system may need accommodations for prayers, for instance, which is one form of support (see the conceptual framework). But the distinct challenges of Muslim youth necessitate more than accommodations. Furthermore, some Muslim students may experience a \"compounding impact\" 18 due to additional barriers and intersecting factors such as race, gender, and class. I therefore carefully selected the word \"support\" rather than \"accommodation\" because modification of a rule does not \"promote [a] sense of belonging\" in a population, as mentioned in the seven guiding principles of the Equity and Inclusive Education Strategy above. Furthermore, \"accommodation\" also does not \"promote well-being,\" 19  provides a quick fix to a problem. \"Support,\" on the other hand, is a commonly used term in Ontario Ministry of Education documents; the motto in each ministry document states, \"support every student.\" Therefore, \"support\" seems like a more fitting word when it comes to helping Muslim students feel safe, included, and connected.\nI define \"supports\" in this article as actions or modifications that assist development of a positive sense of self, well-being, and belonging. Examples of supports are clubs, such as the Muslims Students Association, having a teacher or a paraprofessional (e.g., Support worker or a counsellor) who is Muslim, policies that provide prayer rooms and fasting accommodations during exams or lunch times, Eid announcements or Eid songs played in certain spaces in the schools for specific periods of time, etc.\nWhile \"supports\" can refer to those actions or modifications that were intentionally created for Muslim students, they also include those that serve the Muslim population at the school but were not exclusively created for them, such as diversity clubs that showcase different Muslim cultures and traditions. The support criteria that I will be using for this framework is from Banks' \"Multicultural Education.\" 20 Below, I elaborate on the criteria and further highlight the distinct challenges of Muslim students.\n\nThe Five Dimensions of Banks' Multicultural Education\nBanks is considered the founding father of multicultural education. Multicultural education in Canada focuses on equivalency in achievement, intergroup harmony, and cultural heritage and pride. 21 However, other scholars purport that multicultural education is an umbrella term that means different things to different people. Supporters advocate a \"greater equality of opportunity\" 22 for academic excellence through countering discrimination against individuals and institutions. 23 The Ontario Ministry of Education speaks to intergroup harmony in that students should be equipped \"with the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviours needed to live and work effectively in an increasingly diverse world, and encourage them to appreciate diversity and reject discrimination attitudes and behaviours.\" 24 For this article, I chose the working definition of multicultural education encapsulated by Banks and Banks: An idea, an educational reform movement, and a process whose major goal is to change the structure of educational institutions so that male and female students, exceptional 20 Banks, \"Multicultural Education\". 21 Earl Mansfield and John Kehoe, \"A critical examination of anti-racist education,\" Canadian Journal of Education 19, no.4 (1994). 22  students, and students who are members of diverse racial, ethnic, language, and cultural groups will have an equal chance to achieve academically in school. 25 Some of the terms associated with multicultural education are also associated with multiethnic education, antiracist education, and culturally responsive education. Mostly the differences seem to be a matter of emphasis as mentioned above. 26 Banks developed a model to assist educators and school leaders based on his work in the field, his research, and his observations since the 1960s. 27 There are many different theories, typologies, and models of multicultural education, such as those referenced by Sleeter and Grant,and Burnett. 28 All of those would fit into one or more of Banks's multidimensional frameworks. Banks outlined five dimensions of multicultural education: (a) content integration; (b) knowledge construction; (c) equity pedagogy; (d) prejudice reduction; and (e) empowering school culture and social structure. 29 Banks suggests that all the above dimensions have to be espoused to create and implement a comprehensive multicultural educational program. These dimensions are distinct, but they are interrelated and part of a whole. Each plays a role to level the playing field for students; however, none of them are sufficient on their own. 30\n\n(a) Content Integration\nContent integration refers to the extent to which teachers use symbols and examples from an array of cultures. The Ontario curriculum is viewed as having a Eurocentric lens and colonial contexts, 31 thus students navigating the dominant school culture may face normative expectations that may differ from those that they hold for themselves, rooted in their faith, family beliefs, and cultural practices. The diversity of the student population is not reflected in the curriculum. \"Students who do not belong to the dominant group have a hard time finding themselves and their communities in the curriculum … when they see themselves it will be through the distorted lens of the dominant group. 32 The Ontario Equity and Inclusive Education Strategy mentions \"when students see themselves reflected in their studies, they are more likely to stay engaged and find school relevant.\" 33 By drawing on students' experiences and backgrounds, teachers seize opportunities to help students feel connected to their learning. 34\n\n(b) Knowledge Construction\nThe knowledge construction process moves a step further, whereby teachers help students to understand and investigate implicit cultural assumptions, frames of reference, and perspectives of the specific topic they explore. Asking questions like, whose frame of reference are we using? What are the assumptions used in this research? Whose knowledge? And what is knowledge? For example, Muslims believe that revelation from God (the Quran and the Sunnah) is the highest level of knowledge that is indisputable. Standardized curriculums in most English-speaking countries omit the study of the history and philosophy of science, which hampers the means to understand science as knowledge. Natural sciences are usually attributed with objectivity and neutrality.\nLearning about the nature of science provides grounds for students and teachers to discuss conflicting arguments between science and religion.\n\n(c) Equity Pedagogy\nEquity pedagogy refers to teachers changing their teaching approach to match students' learning styles. Fullan states that student achievement can be improved by \"a sustained and deliberate focus on individual students' strengths and needs.\" 35 For example, Islam is considered a collectivist religion, therefore those who have adopted that worldview may find cooperative teaching more helpful than the competitive and individualistic way of teaching experienced in some classrooms.\n\n(d) Prejudice Reduction\nPrejudice reduction focuses on reducing racist attitudes and finding ways to use teaching approaches and materials to develop positive attitudes. 36  prejudice is very real, and that kids come to school with prejudices toward different groups.\" 37 Delving deeper and asking questions like, \"How is it that Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world and in Canada, yet there is negativity surrounding those who adhere to this religion?\" can help students question racist and prejudicial attitudes.\n\n(e) Empowering School Culture and Social Structure\nEmpowering school culture refers to grouping and labeling practices outside the classroom, as well as sports participation and interaction among staff members. It focuses on the culture, policies, practices, and procedures of the school. Multicultural education is founded on the belief that all students, irrespective of their backgrounds (ethnicity, race, religious affiliation, gender, cultural orientation, language, social class, or exceptionality) should be provided with equal opportunities to access school knowledge. 38 The conceptual framework in Table 1 is intended to be interrelated, complex, and dynamic. The five dimensions of multicultural education, and the possible challenges of Muslim students are interconnected. By filling the cells in Table 1, it will become apparent where the supports are concentrated and where they are lacking, and which of the challenges faced by Muslim students need more support.\n\nPros and Cons of Using Multicultural Education as Criteria for Support for Muslim Students\nI selected \"multicultural education,\" as opposed to \"anti-racist education,\" as a framework through which to assess the supports for Muslims students in a school. The Handbook of Research on Multicultural Education defines \"multicultural education\" as \"a field of study designed to increase educational equity for all students that incorporates for this purpose content concepts, principles, theories, and paradigms from history, the social and behavioural sciences, and ethnic studies and women's studies.\" 39 Whereas anti-racist education is defined by the Ontario Anti-Racism Directorate as \"the practice of identifying, challenging, and changing the values, structures and behaviors that perpetuate systemic racism.\" 40 37 James A. Banks, \"Approaches to multicultural curricular reform\" in E. Lee, D. Multicultural and anti-racist education have different focuses. For example, multicultural educators emphasize \"educational underachievement,\" 41 whereas anti-racist educators focus on \"educational disadvantage.\" 42 Anti-racist education explores a deeper layer of discrimination or inequity. There are also many similarities between the two approaches: both deem their initiatives a mandatory application to the entire curriculum 43 as opposed to being optional or requiring partial integration in the curriculum. Multicultural and anti-racist educators also work diligently against any bias or ethnocentrism in the curriculum. 44 Furthermore, both promote working in small groups and dialoguing to increase interaction between students, 45 and building stronger connections between the home and school environments. 46 The main goal for this conceptual framework is to explore the supports provided in a public school for Muslim students. The framework will not discuss past and present racism and discrimination in schools 47 or help students find examples of institutional racism and confront them. 48 I believe the reality on the ground, unfortunately, is that schools are interested in the goals and focuses of multicultural education: identifying culturally-relevant teaching strategies 49 and curricula 50 for Muslim students, providing basic knowledge of (Muslim) students' own backgrounds, 51 and providing a positive sense of self for Muslim students. 52 Multicultural education does not look at systemic barriers in the school. 53 Exploring institutional racism, or looking deeply at assessment inequalities, 54 is the focus of anti-racist education. Granted, the question arises, can authentic and long-term supports actually be assembled without any assessment of the structural and discursive barriers? I compiled this framework in 2014 based on my preliminary observation and conversation with teachers and administrators. Digging deep into institutional racism and systemic inequalities of schools or district school boards towards Muslims requires the commitment to deep equity from those higher in the system, such as directors of education, superintendents, and principals. Therefore, the conceptual framework, although limited in depth, looks mainly at the reality on the ground: How are Muslim students being supported at their school, using the framework and language that was in place in schools at the time?\n\nGeneral Potential Challenges of Muslim Students\nMuslims in the West face many challenges due to anti-Muslim sentiment towards their religious practices, their creed, and their identification as Muslims, especially with the media's negative portrayal of Muslims. This is not limited to immigrant Muslims, but also to those who were born and raised in Canada and are now, more than ever, afraid to practice their religious beliefs and adhere to a certain dress code. 55 There are numerous reasons why this article focuses on Muslim students, specifically high school students, instead of the rest of the Muslim population. First, for Muslims, high school is a time when they are mandated by their religion to practice their beliefs. Once a Muslim reaches puberty, he or she is obliged to consistently pray five times a day, fast the month of Ramadan, perform the pilgrimage (if physically and financially capable), and give alms. The Arabic word baligh in Islam refers to the time when a person reaches puberty and therefore signals a time of greater responsibility toward observing the religious practices of Islam. Second, research has shown that the adolescent years are a difficult time for youth, given the multitude of pressures from society, home, and school. \"Navigating puberty is one of the major challenges faced by adolescents.\" 56 Adolescents are known for experimenting and also for establishing boundaries: Adolescence represents a crucial period in preventing health compromising and problem behaviors. Many of these critical health-damaging behaviours-such as substance use and abuse, unsafe sexual practices, and dating violence-begin largely during adolescence and can form the basis of lasting behavioral patterns. 57 In addition to the pressures and challenges that come with practicing their beliefs, Muslims also feel the challenges that all other adolescents feel. Third, Muslim students may feel more vulnerable during this stage because they are not well versed in their religion and its corresponding practices. 58 Therefore, navigating not being able to articulate complex reasoning from their faith to use as evidence when asking for a prayer room, or time off for Eid, or to dismantle the stereotypes about Muslims in a class discussion, are difficult challenges. Fourth, adolescents are known to stay under the radar and avoid unnecessary attention during this time of life when they are trying to \"table things out,\" and while their bodies are undergoing \"rapid physical, cognitive and emotional maturation.\" 59 Asking for accommodations and support to practice their faith can be a daunting and draining task. Fifth, Muslim students feel that they are \"different\" from their counterparts. Adolescence is when children most want to \"fit in,\" and Muslim students feel that if they practice their faith or are identified as Muslim, they will be seen as \"different.\" Adolescent years are known to be a vulnerable and anxious time; when coupled with additional pressures to practice a faith that has been stereotyped and demonized (specifically by the media, and perhaps perpetuated by their teachers and peers), Muslim youth are faced with challenges many adults would struggle with.\nReviewing the literature and the Guidelines and Procedures: For the Accommodation of Religious Requirements, Practices, and Observances, 60 I have categorized the potential challenges that Muslim students face in their schools in six categories: religious practice, dress code, sexual ethics, myths and stereotypes, Islamophobia, and curriculum-related issues. 61 These challenges are all intertwined; they are all interrelated. Muslim students may or may not feel all/some/none of those challenges. The horizontal rows of the conceptual framework (Table 1), show the overt differences that demarcate the additional potential challenges that face Muslims versus their peers. I have focused on the general overt practices and challenges that distinguish Muslim students from their non-Muslim peers. These potential challenges are directly related to Muslims' adherence to their faith and their outward visibility as \"Muslims.\" There are other case-by-case differences that may emerge on a day-to-day basis. For example, Sabry recalls when her then sixth-grade daughter came home from school and asked for a Christmas stocking. 62 When Sabry refused on the grounds that Muslims have different celebrations, the daughter was distraught. Because she did not bring a Christmas stocking to school, she did not receive any candy.\nResearch on Muslim students shows that Muslims tend to highlight their religious identity, unlike other faith groups, 63 albeit the \"highlighting\" of Muslim students' identity could simply be a direct effect of the school's exclusion of Muslim students in explicit and implicit curricula. In other words, when Muslim students are not included in the overall and specific culture of their classrooms and their respective schools, then naturally they will appear \"highlighted\" and they will stand out as the \"other.\" Therefore, it is difficult for a Muslim who is in continuous contact 59   with other non-Muslim individuals (e.g., at work, in school, in residence) to practice his or her religion without being a \"visible\" Muslim; someone who is identified and seen as a \"Muslim.\" However, the research specifically shows that Muslim students generally, compared to other faith groups and irrespective of the surrounding culture, showcase their Islamic identity. 64 For example, the Environics Institute survey shows that Muslims are more likely to place a higher importance on their religious identity over their Canadian identity. 65 This is often characterized as Muslims' division of loyalties, but the Islamophobic milieu of 2016 perhaps pushed Muslims to choose between continuing to wear their Hijab (their Islamic identity) and taking it off to \"fit in\" with the dominant culture and feel safe. Muslims may have attributed feeling unsafe, targeted, and losing their freedom to their practicing of their religion freely. However, such association is flawed because the socio-political climate was Islamophobic, and therefore such sentiments reflected and were encouraged by the social fabric of society. Many researchers in this field have challenged the clash of civilization theory, demonstrating that one can be both Muslim and a Westerner, even though with so many cultures, languages, and social differences, the Western hemisphere and those who are Muslims are hardly homogeneous. 66 Regarding the potential challenges of Muslim students in schools, a guideline surfaced in the early 2000s and was adapted by the district school Boards in Ontario entitled Guidelines and Procedures: For the Accommodation of Religious Requirements, Practices, and Observances 67 geared toward all faiths. The guideline is divided into two sections. One section gives general guidelines and procedures on multiple topics, such as religious holidays, dietary requirements, religious attire, and so on. The second section gives a description of each religion and the corresponding challenges that students may face, along with suggestions for accommodations. The section on Islam has about 13 pages detailing challenges and corresponding accommodations that Muslims may face with respect to their everyday school activities. This guideline is a resource used by principals and administrators when a student asks for an accommodation. I looked at all the potential challenges to Muslims listed in the guideline, and the potential challenges listed in the conceptual framework of this chapter captures the challenges categorically. The challenges listed in the conceptual framework also include \"myths, stereotypes and biases,\" and Islamophobia, which the guideline does not mention. I have listed, in detail, a breakdown of the six challenges that Muslim students may face in their schools. All the challenges are related to one another; one challenge does not stand alone without the others. For example, the challenges of the Islamic dress code and Islamic sexual ethics are interrelated with curriculum-related issues. However, I have discussed each challenge below separately for clarity purposes. These challenges are mainly associated with students in a public school in the West because of their adherence, in 64 Ibid. varying degrees, to their faith. Other faith groups may face one or more of these challenges; however, they are more specific and relevant to those who adhere to the Islamic faith-Muslims.\n\nReligious Practice\nReligious practices refer to the five pillars of Islam with the three mainly relevant pillars of Islam in relation to schools being prayers, fasting, and perhaps performing the pilgrimage.\nWith respect to prayers, Muslim students may face the challenge of where and when to pray. The two main prayers that fall during the school hours are the afternoon (dhuhr) and the evening ('Asr) prayers. Prayers can be performed anywhere. Students may pray in a corner in their cafeteria, in their classrooms, in the school yard, in the school parking lot, and so on. However, students may not feel comfortable performing their prayers unless there is a specific space designated to do so. Muslim prayer takes five to ten minutes, and students may feel distracted, anxious, self-conscious, or they may be interrupted if they pray in a space that is not specifically designated for prayers. Therefore, students may require a quiet space to pray during the allocated prayer times. Also, prior to performing their prayers, students are required to do a ceremonial wash called wudu, or an ablution, and they may not feel comfortable performing that in the regular school washrooms. This wash includes the washing of the face, hands, and feet.\nBecause of the fasting requirement, students may need extensions on assignments, exams postponed, or a physical education class cut short. Ramadan is the month when Muslims, who have reached puberty and are physically able, are mandated to fast 29 or 30 days from everything (food, drink, and sexual activity) from dawn to dusk. Islam follows the lunar calendar. For example, in 2016, Ramadan fell in June. In 2017, it will fall in May. In summer, which is a stretch of 18 to 19 hours from dawn to dusk, it may be difficult for some students who choose to fast to focus during class or exams. The sick, pregnant, breastfeeding and lactating mothers, menstruating women, and travelers are exempt from fasting, if needed.\nThe pilgrimage (Hajj) is mandated for anyone who is physically and financially able to participate. It takes place in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, once a year. Students who go with their families to perform this ritual require two or more weeks off from school. This is only mandated once in the lifetime of a Muslim.\n\nIslamic Dress Code\nThere are 1.7 billion Muslims in the world and subsequently dress code will vary from person to person, family to family, city to city, and country to country. There is diversity of individual interpretations on dress code and sexual ethics. In the following paragraphs, I will be specifically discussing the guidelines from the major two sects of Islam, the Sunni (mainly the 4 schools of thoughts: Hanafi, Hanbali, Shaafi, and Maliki) and Shi'a, which are derived from the Quran and the Sunnah (the prophet's sayings and doings), regarding dress code and the conduct of men and women. Exploring the following topics briefly here will help teachers and administrators to some degree understand the Muslim students who adhere to all, most, or some of these guidelines.\nDress code is part of the emblematic character of Islam. Men and women's Islamic dress codes are different based on what constitutes the private areas of the body ('Awra). For a man, the private area of his body, according to Islamic jurisprudence, is from the navel to the knee. For a woman, it is the same area when she is in the presence of other women. Breasts are not considered private in the company of other women in order to make it easier for lactating mothers to breastfeed in front of female friends and family members without any restrictions. In the presence of men who are not family members, women cover all their body parts except for their hands and face. Some Muslim women choose to cover their hands and face as well, because they adhere to different schools of thought. Men and women are also required to dress modestly by wearing loose and nontransparent clothes. Although not mandatory, some Muslim males choose to wear a kufi, or a thawb, and Muslim women choose to wear a niqab.\nEven when swimming at public beaches or public pools, Muslim women cover. Muslim women are also required to cover their head with a veil called Hijab, which means \"a cover.\" Research shows that the wearing of Hijab in a non-accepting environment may lead to low self-esteem, and not conforming to dominant social rules of dressing can compromise one's academic achievement. 68 It is important in this section to briefly outline and mention the media's increasing attention regarding the dress of Muslim females. In 2015, a controversy brewed over a woman wearing niqab during a Canadian citizenship ceremony. 69 Furthermore, the news reported the introduction of a Burkini ban in France. Muslim women who wanted to go to the beach were not allowed to wear a special kind of swimsuit (Burkini) that covered them from head to ankle. 70 Recently, Quebec introduced the Laïcité Law, or secularism bill, Bill 21, prohibiting the wearing of religious symbols (e.g., Hijab, Karpan, etc) by public servants, such as teachers.\n\nIslamic Sexual Ethics\nIslam, according to the four major schools of thought in the Sunni tradition and the major schools of thought in the Shi'a tradition, is a gender-specific religion. The challenges of Islamic sexual ethics mainly revolve around cross-gender relations and modesty in clothing, as well as the issue of modesty in behaviour. I use the word \"modesty\" here, but the correct term in Arabic and Islam-Hayaa-does not have an equivalent word in English. There are a few issues in sexual ethics that apply within a high school context, after reaching puberty: • The rules of cross-gender relations in Islam stipulate that men and women try not to engage in any body contact, such as playing tag, high fives, pats on the back, shaking hands, and so on. • Islam prohibits any intimate relations before marriage; therefore, having a boyfriend or a girlfriend is not allowed in Islam. • Muslim males and females who adhere to Islamic sexual ethics do not change their clothes in front of one another, because their body from the navel to the knees is considered private (Awra).\nGranted, not all Muslims follow these guidelines. Some Muslims follow more restrictive rules, while others are more lenient, and others do not follow nor believe in this aspect of Islam. When it comes to Muslim youth in high school and perhaps beyond, the youth who choose to follow the restrictive rules face specific challenges surrounding sexual ethics as those rules are the most difficult to adhere to. The challenge with sexual ethics is that the dominant culture in the West has a different view of sexual ethics, which conflicts with the Islamic view, upheld by both Shi'a and the Sunni schools of thoughts mentioned above. The dominant view of sexual ethics in the West also views the Islamic worldview of sexual ethics (which includes dress code) as oppressive and inferior, and hence makes it difficult to seek understanding and accommodation.\n\nMyths, Stereotypes, and Personal Biases\nThe negative portrayal of Muslims in the media may lead individuals to believe negative myths and stereotypes about Muslims. A stereotype is when one perceives another person based on a specific category; thereby, squeezing him or her into a limited definition. 71 Human beings stereotype all the time; making a general statement about something is to stereotype. This kind of stereotyping helps to reduce the complexity of the information we receive. 72 However, stereotyping becomes problematic when one stereotypes other people because of their membership of a certain group. For example, a common stereotype about Muslims is that men dominate women. 73 Myths, on the other hand, are beliefs held about other people that are untrue. 74 For example, people may believe that all Muslims are Arabs, whereas in reality only 24% of Muslims are Arabs. Lack of correct information leads to both stereotyping and the developing of myths. 75 Those stereotypes and myths become a personal bias, which may lead one to treat or think of another person unfairly. Even people who have strong egalitarian values and believe that they are not biased may unconsciously behave in discriminatory ways. 76 It is difficult to rid oneself of personal bias. However, research shows that when one group interacts with a member of another group, one may deconstruct their personal biases. This kind of contact between a marginalized and non-marginalized group is summed up by the intergroup contact theory, 77 which states that the more contact an in-group (non-Muslims, in this case) has with an out-group (Muslims), the greater improvement in attitudes and fewer biases are held against them. However, this is not the case all the time. Further, research suggests that when there are preconceived notions or negative stereotypes of an out-group, then there is increased public anxiety, which reduces the beneficial effects of contact with the out-group 78 , as well as increasing the in-group's reliance on negative stereotypes. Personal biases do not just cause anxiety; some researchers even suggest increased hostility occurring against the out-group. 79 Nonetheless, the idea that \"familiarity breeds liking,\" or what social psychologists call the \"mere exposure effect\", 80 and the intergroup contact theory explained above, seem to be evident in today's emerging surveys regarding Muslims. 81 Interestingly, Chalabi states that her survey demonstrated that younger non-Muslims who are in continuous contact with Muslims tend to have a more positive view of the Muslim population than older non-Muslims. 82 The age that separates the young from the old was not specified in the aforementioned survey.\nWhen it comes to schools, studies have been conducted on teachers' attitudes toward Muslims.\nResults of the studies show that some teachers in public schools hold negative attitudes toward Muslims. 83 Teachers' preconceived notions, attitudes, and biases affect curricula and their relationships with their Muslim students at both conscious and subconscious levels. 84 Teacher attitudes and worldviews are considered to be part of the hidden or deep curriculum of the school. 85 The Ontario Royal Commission on Education spoke highly of the importance of teachers in students' lives: \"the teacher is the keystone of the educational arch: in the final analysis, the fulfillment of educational aims rest with him/her\". 86 Teachers are an integral part of the education system. The way they perceive and interact with their students manifests in the pupil's emotional and academic well-being. Furthermore, studies have shown that positive relationships lead to better academic outcomes. 87 However, conflict in this relationship also leads to antisocial behaviour and aggression from the students. 88 Teachers' personal biases may result in unfair treatment or prejudgment of students and cause tension in student-teacher relations. Amjad suggests that teachers' lack of understanding of the experiences of their Muslim students, as well as the students' cultural and religious backgrounds, led to their annoyance and impatience when it came to helping their Muslim students. 89 For example, \"Often, teachers made comments in front of other students without realizing how hurtful they might be for their young students, who have a natural need for respect among their peers.\" 90 Another pertinent study by Niyozov and Pluim extensively reviews comparative and international literature on teachers' views of Muslim students in public schools, and acknowledges that there are negative biases held by teachers. However, the researchers also conclude that the teachers in public schools in Canada and in the West are trying \"to understand and accommodate the needs of Muslim students…it is important to acknowledge the progress and the system's willingness to accommodate.\" 91\n\nIslamophobia\nRecent polls have shown that there is an epidemic of Islamophobia in Ontario. Islamophobia is defined as \"the dread, hatred, and hostility toward Islam and Muslims perpetrated by a series of closed views that imply and attribute negative and derogatory stereotypes and beliefs to Muslims.\" 92 According to the survey published by Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants, half of Ontarians in 2016 feel that Islam promotes violence. 93 One in three Canadian Muslims have experienced discrimination. 94 Muslim women and Muslim youth are the main recipients of this discrimination. 95 Visible Muslims are immediately identified due to their appearance, and, therefore, are at a higher risk for being victims of hate crimes. Individuals who choose to adhere to the Islamic dress code can be easily identified as Muslims. Such a choice may come with risks and challenges-risks of discrimination and of being the target of hate crimesin addition to the internal and social challenges of feeling accepted, respected, and having an \"equal status\" to the majority, as suggested by Banks. 96 Just to mention a few examples, in Toronto-a city that is considered the most diverse in Canada-multiple hate crimes were committed against women wearing Hijab. 97 A woman was punched and had her Hijab removed from her head when she was picking up her child from school. Another woman wearing Hijab was pushed and called a terrorist on a Toronto bus. Yet another woman, who was not Muslim, was assaulted because she wore a scarf similar to a Hijab. 98 The negative portrayal of Islam in the media feeds these hate crimes and the pre-existing stereotypes and myths about Muslims.\nIn schools, Islamophobia can manifest in different ways. Systemic Islamophobia refers to a system whereby Islam and Muslims are disadvantaged in the policies, procedures, and practices of an institution that may appear to be neutral. Such forms of discrimination are manifested in the lack of hiring of Muslim teachers and of not promoting Muslim teachers into positions of leadership. The background of Ontario teachers does not reflect the background of the students in their respective schools. The Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) identified this as one of the contributing factors to the disproportionate suspension and expulsion of racialized students as a lack of teacher representation. 99 Despite the increasing number of diverse students in Ontario public schools, the majority of teachers continue to be from white, middle class, monolingual backgrounds. 100 Another way that systemic Islamophobia is demonstrated is through the perpetuation of Eurocentric ideology and maintaining a subhuman narrative of Muslims in class and school materials. 101 A specific example of systemic Islamophobia is in the dispute that arose when Valley Park Middle School's principal allowed 400 Muslim students to perform their Friday prayers in the cafeteria in March of 2012. The majority of students in Valley Park, which is in Markham, Ontario, were Muslims-over 800 students. The controversy around this erupted when some members of the community feared that having Muslim prayers in the cafeteria could \"spread their (Islamic) ideology\" and open doors to the other more than \"50 different ethnicities and religions asking for different accommodations.\" 102 Though holding Friday prayers in schools has become common practice for most schools in Ontario, increased scrutiny and negative stereotyping and discrimination are experiences that Muslims still feel within their communities. Students are reporting that every year they have to re-establish with the school administration the rationale and re-negotiate the space for Friday prayers and their daily prayers as opposed to having those supports as given affordances according to the Ontario Human Rights Commission. 103\n\nCurriculum-Related Issues\nThere are two types of curricula in schools: the explicit curriculum and the implicit or deep curriculum. Curriculum is defined in many different ways. 104 In simple terms, a curriculum is everything a student experiences in a school. 105 The explicit curriculum is what is observed in ministry documents and teachers' plans. The educational environment in which the actual, or explicit, curriculum is taught is referred to as the implicit curriculum, 106 the deep curriculum, 107 or the hidden curriculum. 108 The explicit curriculum identifies the colonial and Eurocentric narrative that exists in class materials and textbooks. Abukhattala searched Canadian textbooks and found that \"their portrayal of Islam contains erroneous factual claims, questionable assertions and omissions that reinforce negative stereotypes.\" 109 Muslims are \"depicted as fanatical terrorists, sexually enticing, and/or the despotic other.\" 110 Similarly, with respect to the implicit curriculum, intentionally or unintentionally neglecting to represent other communities' societal and historical contributions in both the curriculum and the classroom affects the learning environment for students of those communities. 111 Some examples of implicit curriculum are representation and recognition of Muslims and Muslim contribution to knowledge production. Language and practices, such as celebration of holidays, are other examples of the implicit curriculum that is imparted in schools. In Canada, Eurocentric knowledge continues to be the starting point for all sciences, social sciences, and literature in the curriculum, 112 which can be alienating for Muslim students. 113 Research has shown the negative impacts of a Eurocentric curriculum on those who do not identify as European or \"white.\" 114 Gay suggests that classrooms be more consistent with students' cultural orientation. Classrooms should be more reflective of the students and their identities so that students can self-identify with their learning and in their classrooms. 115 Integrating Muslim knowledge and contributions, and representing them in the \"mainstream\" curriculum, is part of inclusive education and is one of the tenets of multicultural education. The integration process does not just involve celebrating Ramadan and Eid, accommodating daily prayers, and celebrating a Diversity Day; rather, it should go beyond superficial and sentimental efforts, and involve a more meaningful discussion. 116 By including Muslim perspectives, teachers can help engage Muslims in the learning process by providing them with content relevant to their experiences and culture, which would increase their sense of belonging and improve their selfesteem. Other students can benefit from Muslim knowledge, contributions, and symbols by being introduced to intercultural knowledge and experience, and also by sparking meaningful dialogues among different cultural groups, as well as among teachers and students. Such knowledge can also challenge the dominant Western paradigm and expand a learner's horizons beyond that which is familiar to them. 117 Furthermore, \"the inclusion of Muslim history and Muslim contributions in Western public school curricula is surely legitimate, not only for affirming Muslim students' selfesteem and identity, but also because it is part of the antihegemonic discourse.\" 118 This is not intended to exclude other knowledge -other non-Western knowledge would also challenge the current discourse-\"but to contribute to a plurality of perspectives and knowledge about schooling in the Euro-Canadian context.\" 119 Especially in light of the negative portrayals of Muslims so prominent in the media, knowledge of Muslims and their contributions may act as a healthy barrier against fear, racism, and discrimination.\n\nAn Example of What the Conceptual Framework Can Look Like\nHaving now defined each of Banks' Five Dimensions of Multiculturalism and identified the challenges most prominently faced by Muslim youth, as articulated in the literature review and the documents provided by Ontario school boards, I would like to refer back to the framework and demonstrate how the matrix can look by providing an example for each of the categories ( Table  2). The idea is not to fill out each cell with an example of support, but to use the framework as a graphic organizer to ensure that each of the six common challenges that Muslim students face are alleviated so that no matter who they are and how they identify, each student feels supported and can have a sense of belonging and a positive sense of self. There is an understanding in equity studies that by sharing other people's ways of knowing and doing, everyone benefits.\n\nReligious Practices\nIn certain subjects such as arts, social studies or physical education show religious practices of Muslims (e.g., for healthy and physical education show prayers as a de-stressing and wellness mechanism for Muslims) Asking students whose religious practices is dominant, normative and accepted in policy and practice. And why is that so? Why aren't other religious practices included in our policies and practices in schools and in society?\nSeeing Muslim students pray. Inviting someone who wears hijab to speak about their hijab. Inviting someone who wears niqab to speak about their niqab and Bill 21.\nMuslim students are included in school decisionmaking. Muslim students are included in sports activities if they choose to adhere by a dress code. Adding school accommodations (e.g., prayer room, Eid holidays, exam accommodations during fasting month) in the agenda of the Muslim students so they do not have to muster up the courage to ask.\n\nDress Code & Sexual Ethics\nIn certain subjects (e.g., arts, social studies and health and physical education) show Asking students why is the dress code of Muslims (e.g., hijab, loose and longer shirts\n\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this article is to present a conceptual framework for public school administrators and educators to assess their support systems provided to Muslim students. The conceptual framework offered in Table 1 is a two-dimensional matrix representing the five dimensions of Banks's multicultural education, and the six common struggles that Muslim students face in schools, adapted from the literature. Schools and those in the school system can use this conceptual framework as a starting point to assess the supports, or lack thereof, in place for Muslim students. The framework is not meant to substitute for deeper conversations and investigations that are required for each school to identify the institutional and structural barriers and discrimination that are embedded in the school systems. Table 1 offers a graphic organizer to check off the cells and also provides evidence (using artefacts, observations, and conversations with student and staff) to give a visual representation of which of the challenges of Muslim students are adequately being met vis-à-vis the categories of Banks's multicultural criteria and which of their challenges need further support. This article provides some details on each of the challenges faced by Muslim students in a school setting and suggests using Banks's multicultural education and specific ways of offering the necessary supports."

              "A Philosopher Looks at the Religious Life\n\nWhat is happiness? Does life have a meaning? If so, is that meaning available in an ordinary life? The philosopher Zena Hitz confronted these questions head-on when she spent several years living in a Christian religious community. Religious life -- the communal life chosen by monks, nuns, friars, and hermits -- has been a part of global Christianity since earliest times, but many of us struggle to understand what could drive a person to renounce wealth, sex, children, and ambition to live a life of prayer and sacrifice. Hitz's lively and accessible book explores questions about faith, sacrifice, asceticism and happiness through philosophy, stories, and examples from religious life. Drawing on personal experience as well as film, literature, history, biography, and theology, it demystifies an important element of contemporary culture, and provides a picture of human flourishing and happiness which challenges and enriches modern-day life."

              "Vekhi (Milestones) as a Post-Secular Manifesto of the Russian Philosophy\n\nThe article investigates the  Vekhi (Milestones), a collection of articles published  in 1909 by Nikolai Berdyaev, Sergei Bulgakov, Mikhail Gershenzon, Bogdan Kistyakovski, Peter Struve, Semyon  Frank and  Aleksandr Izgoev,  that  is analyzed  through the prism of the post-secularization, which became the dominant in the  Russian intellectual culture of the  early 20th century.  This phenomenon implied a rapid advancement of various forms  of religious philosophy into the  centre  of the  Russian philosophical tradition  in search  for solution to various problems  faced by the state,  society, family and education,  reflected in the articles of the Milestones authors.  The collection became  most widely known — and criticized — among  the leftist intelligentsia, which made this book an absolute bestseller in the history of the Russian philosophical thought. The position of its authors,  deeply post-secular,  antiutilitarian and anti-scientistic, and their criticism of the politicized groundless intelligentsia were the main reasons for the retaliation. The trick was a convincing reconstruction of an “average  intellectual’s” consciousness. The Russian intelligentsia gave birth to a lot of prominent cultural figures. But it also gave birth to ambitious people  who considered themselves to be the  salt of the  earth, the stateless apatrides who hate  everything Russian and admire everything  European  or American. The Milestones  authors were among the first in Russia to show that  the fruits of the intelligentsia revolution are non-national, groundless phenomena, in no way connected with Russian foundations and traditions.  The intellectuals’ political consciousness is irreligious and based  on atheism, but it has many similarities with religion and acquires the features of some atheistic pseudo-religion. The Milestones contained sharp and justified criticism directed  at the intransigent party struggle, the love of extremes and the predilection for egalitarianism, that is, those pseudo-religious  qualities of the intelligentsia that  have a pronounced anti-cultural and anti-national orientation."

              "Use of “Philosophy for Children” Approach for Developing Critical Thinking Skills in Religious Culture and Ethics Course\n\nCritical thinking skills, often referred to as higher-order cognitive skills, are considered important for the Religious Culture and Ethics Course due to gains such as pupils’ taking responsibility of their own learning, actively constructing knowledge, supporting the development of other high-level thinking skills such as reflective and creative thinking. As students’ critical and inquiring thinking skills increase, they can also develop a number of related skills, such as the ability to explain issues in more detail, evaluate learning topics in relation to their own lives, become aware of different perspectives on problem situations, and question the reliability of information resources. One of the effective approaches for pupils to acquire critical thinking, inquiry and questioning skills is the 'Philosophy for Children' approach, which was developed by Matthew Lipman in the early 1970s’ and has been applied in many countries, for different school subjects since then. The main aim of this approach is to develop students' thinking and reasoning skills through philosophical discussions in the classroom. The 'Philosophy for Children' model stands out as an effective approach in religious education by creating dialogic and collaborative teaching-learning environments, encouraging students to inquire and question, and developing critical and reflective thinking skills. In our country, Religious Culture and Ethics Course curriculum, which highly considers inquiry and questioning in learning, aims to ensure that students learn by making sense of the content and using high-level thinking processes. Instead of a traditional, teacher-centred and rote religious education, it is aimed for students to become learner agents who inquire, question, strive to reach the source of knowledge, and actively construct knowledge. Therefore, Religious Culture and Ethics course requires teachers to use strategies, methods and techniques that enable students to develop and use high-level thinking processes. ‘Philosophy for Children’ approach has also been used in religious education in England and in Islamic religious as well as ethic courses in Malaysia. The studies undertaken in these countries have provided important contributions to students' active participation in the lessons, development of critical thinking and reasoning skills, self-confidence, self-esteem and social relations. This study is a literature review examining the theoretical foundations of the 'Philosophy for Children' approach, its application and evaluation processes, as well as its use in religious education by looking into both international and national literature. The aim of the study is to examine the 'Philosophy for Children' approach, which is thought to be useful in developing effective learning skills such as inquiry, questioning, problem solving and critical thinking related to concepts and problems of religion and morality in the primary and secondary Religious Culture and Ethics Course curriculum. Besides recommendations and implications are made for this course."

              "Developing Islamic Legal Philosophy-Based Assurance of Justice\n\nJustice is the essence of law enforcement. Justice is importan in the legal system at various countries, The absensce of justice was problem because if legal system lack of justice there would be made public believe ruined and legal system would collapse. In the Islamic legal thought, justice was the essence. However, it cannot be denied that the development of Islamic legal thought cannot be separated from the conception of justice. Justice in the explanation is included in the category of substantive law. Justice is defined from a theological point of view, God's relationship with humans is vertical. Allah as the Most Just and Most Right knows the truth and ultimate justice. Humans must always find justice and truth given by God through the process of ijtihad. The principle of justice requires the use of ratios to make comparisons between one case that is not explained by the Word of God or the words of the Prophet with another case that has legal legitimacy. In that way, Islamic law develops and reaches a wider range of legal cases based on the principle of equality."

              "Collection of Manuscripts in Oirat in Ulan-Khol khurul of Kalmykia\n\nThis article presents a brief overview of the collection of manuscripts in the Oirat language stored in the fund of the Ulan-Khol Temple of the Republic of Kalmykia. The collection under consideration is relatively small (50 manuscripts), but it contains very interesting materials. The manuscripts of the Ulan-Khol Temple were a part of a significant collection of Buddhist writings in Tibetan, Old Mongolian and Oirat in the library of the Shars-Bagut (Northern) Temple, which was located from 1889 to 1939 in the area of Bora, Shars-Bagut aimak located in Erketenevsky ulus. The manuscripts were transferred to the Ulan-Khol Temple by relatives of the clergymen Bodgur Ochirov (1892-1955) and Tsagan Atkhaev (1900-1981). The collection seems to be extremely heterogeneous: it includes fiction literature works, orders, prophecies, ritual texts, prayers, astrological works, texts of divination, weather signs and traditional folk medicine texts. Some collections contain texts in Oirat with Tibetan inclusions as well as ones in Tibetan with Oirat interlinear. The fact proves Kalmyk monks were equally fluent in Tibetan and Oirat. The heterogeneity of the composition of the manuscript collection of the Ulan-Khol khurul indicates that the monks of the Shars-Bagut Temple in their main practice were not only clergymen, but also astrologers, soothsayers, healers. The presented texts are a valuable source for studying traditional religious beliefs, philosophy, ethics, old written Kalmyk literature, astrology and Kalmyk cult rituals."

              "Character Education Values Of Batik Tulis At Widya Batik Ubud, Bali\n\nThis study aims to determine the values of character education implicit in Batik Tulis at Widya Batik Ubud, Bali. There are two Batik studied, namely the work entitled Bunga Lotus and Mandala Yoga . The method used in this research is qualitative. Data collection methods used are documents, interviews\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nEducation is a conscious and planned effort to create a learning atmosphere and learning process so that students actively develop their potential to have religious spiritual strength, self-control, personality, intelligence, noble character, and the skills needed by themselves, society, nation and state (Wahyuni, 2022:30). To achieve this, in the learning process it is necessary to explain the value of character education contained in each subject.\nCharacter education is a conscious and planned human effort to educate and empower potential students to build their personal character so that they can become individuals who benefit themselves and their environment (Santika, 2022:45). Character education needs to be given to students. Currently there is a tendency of moral degradation in adolescents. Adolescent ethics or manners are decreasing, tolerance is getting weaker. The rapid development of information and technology in the era of globalization has also resulted in changes in people's mindsets, words and behavior, resulting in the weakening of the nation's noble values.\nCharacter education to be internalized by the Ministry of National Education has eighteen points of attitude that need to be developed which include: religious, honest, tolerance, discipline, hard work, creative, independent, democratic, curiosity, national spirit, love for the homeland, respect for achievement, friendly / communicative, love peace, love to read, care for the environment, care about social, and responsibility, Pupus (in Ariyawan, 2018: 2). The government hopes that character education can be applied as a whole for children and the community. For this reason, efforts to strengthen character education are very important 10).\nOne of the media that can be used to apply the value of character education is through artworks. Art has a very close relationship with character education. Art in general talks a lot about the value of life andlife, which inevitably will be directly related to the formation of human character. One of the works of art that can be used to instill the value of character education is batik.\nBatik has long existed in Indonesia. It was occupied by our ancestors as a form of culture. On October 2, 2009, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has recognized and designated Indonesian batik as a world heritage. Because of this recognition, batik is said to be able to foster a sense of love for the homeland and participate in preserving the heritage of the Indonesian nation's ancestors which has been recognized by the world. When making batik, it takes an atmosphere that is full of calm or silence so that the batik maker can unite taste and intention into his work. In addition, the motifs and various decorative strokes produced from batik also have a philosophy and meaning of appeal to the Creator. Batik is the result of creativity, batik has various kinds of motifs, both existing motifs and new motifs that are made according to the wishes of the batik maker. Through batik automatically will be able to give birth and develop creative ideas in a person.\nOne of the areas in Indonesia that is still developing the art of batik is Bali. In Bali itself, Ubud is the center of art, and Batik is no exception. Many batik craftsmen, both from stamped batik, painted batik and written batik, are still developing from the past until now. Widya Batik is one of the places in Ubud that makes batik by Mr. Widya Harsana. In addition to making works of art to be produced in the market, Mr. Widya also makes works of art with his own trademark, namely his batik motif which has a spiritual smell. In addition, Widya Batik also provides batik classes for those who are interested in learning batik. Because of that, researchers are interested in researching at Widya Batik, where this place is the place where it was created the result of batik art that has character education values.\nIn this regard, the authors are interested in researching \"The Values of Character Education in Written Batik at Widya Batik Ubud, Bali\". The problem that can be formulated is how are the values of character education implied in written batik at Widya Batik Ubud, Bali? To solve this problem, several theories are used, namely semiotic theory and character education.\n\nSemiotic Theory\nSemiotics is etymologically derived from the Greek word (semion) which means sign. Etymologically semiotics can be defined as the science of signs. According to Saussure, semiotics is divided into two (2) parts, namely the signifier and the signified. The signifier is the material aspect of the sign that can be sensed or can be sensory, while the signified is an aspect that can be referred to as a concept. The signifier can be seen as a form/form, and the signified is seen as a meaning that is revealed through the concepts, values/functions contained in the form/form.\n\nCharacter Building\nAccording to Santrock (in Patmawati, 2013: 10) Character education is a direct approach to moral education, namely teaching students with basic moral knowledge to prevent them from committing immoral acts that can harm themselves and others.\nAccording to the Ministry of National Education (Praditya, 2018: 25), the values of character education that will be internalized to students or young people can be concluded into 18 namely religious, honest, tolerance, discipline, hard work, creative, independent, democracy, curiosity, spirit of nationality, love the homeland, appreciate achievements, friendly / communicative, love peace, love to read, care for the environment, care about social, and responsibility.\n\nMETHODS\nThis research is a type of qualitative research that is more descriptive in nature, the data collected is in the form of words or pictures, so it does not emphasize numbers, Bogdan and Biklen (in Sugiyono, 2015: 22). Where the analysis emphasizes the understanding of the object of research, namely the values of character education in written batik at Widya Batik.\nThe data collection methods used in this study are the methods of documentation, interviews, and observation.\n\nDocumentation Method\nAccording to Sugiyono (2015: 329), the documentation method is a record of events that have passed. Writings, paintings, and works that give the impression are called documents. This is the data obtained from photos of written batik motifs by Widya Harsana entitled Lotus and Mandala Yoga.\n\nInterview Method\nAccording to Esterberg (in Sugiyono, 2015: 317), the interview is a meeting of two or more people to exchange information and ideas through question and answer, so that meaning can be constructed in a particular topic. The data obtained were in the form of interviews regarding the meaning of the colors, symbols, and shapes of each of Widya Harsana's written batik motifs entitled Bunga Lotus and Mandala Yoga.\n\nObservation Method\nNasution in (Sugiyono, 2015: 310) argues that observation activities are the basis of all branches of science. For that, experts must work based on data. This means that the facts depicting the state of the world are expressed through the process of observation. In this regard, the data obtained in this study is by observing directly the research subject with come to Widya Batik which is in the Ubud area.\nThe data collection technique used in this research is the card and note technique. The purpose of using data cards and recording is to make it easier for researchers to collect data systematically and make it easier to study it. This technique serves to avoid errors due to forgetfulness, given the limited ability and memory of the author. These steps include: (1) identification, (2) data reduction, (3) data presentation and processing, (4) drawing conclusions.\n\nData Identification Lotus\nThis work is in the form of a scarf made of silk. In the work there are two motives, namely the main motive and isen/additional motives. The main motif in this work is a good lotus flower in bloom, in bud, lotus seeds and its leaves, while the isen motif in this work is a leaf-like shape made with a stamp technique as a complement to the edges of the motif. The lotus flower is a freshwater plant, the lotus flower is often referred to as a spiritual symbol. This flower character grows in three different media/levels of nature, namely soil (mud), water, and air. The roots and tubers grow creeping in the mud at the bottom of the water, the stems grow in the water, and the leaves and flowers float above the surface of the water. The lotus flower grows in dirty muddy water, but that doesn't diminish the beauty of the lotus flower. In fact, the lotus flower will make its dirty environment beautiful. This is also related to the concept of Hinduism, namely Tri Hita Karana (Santika, 2021).\nThe lotus flower in the work is depicted in red. This red color is interpreted as a color that can attract attention because red has the value and strength of the strongest color to attract the attention of those who see it. This color is liked by many people, especially children and women. In addition, this color can also attract attention, red is also symbolized as the color of joy and courage. Deep blue spiral shape the background of the work is likened to water where the lotus flower itself lives, the blue color has a cool and peaceful character. Blue is a cool color and symbolizes holiness, hope and peace. The green color in the shape of a lotus leaf is made as it is in its original state. This color is relatively neutral, restful, and symbolizes contemplation and eternity.\n\nMandala Yoga\nThis work is in the form of a long cloth measuring 2 meters x 1 meter which is used as a display. In the work there are 2 motifs, namely the main motif and the isen/additional motif. The main motifs in this work are decorative forms of people who are meditating/yoga, decorative shapes of garuda wings, poleng motifs, floral motifs, and mandala motifs in which there is ongkara script, while the isen motif in this work is a heart shape that fills the colored poleng motif. blue. The decorative form of people who are meditating/yoga can be realized as Lord Vishnu. Under this ascetic person his form is described as an eagle, where the garuda is the mount of Lord Vishnu.\nThe poleng motif in the work can be described as Rwa Bhineda. Rwa bhineda is a dualistic concept in Balinese culture. Poleng motifs are generally depicted in black and white, but in Widya Harsana's batik work, it is made by pouring red and blue colors. The colors red and blue have different characters, namely red is a hot color character while blue is a cold color character. The floral motif in the work means the cardinal directions. In the concept of Hinduism, the ruler of the cardinal directions is called Dewata Nawa Sanga. Dewata Nawa Sanga are nine deities who are worshiped as the nine cardinal directions. The mandala motif in the work is defined as the concentration of the mind during meditation. Inside the mandala motif there is an image of the ongkara script, the ongkara script is a sacred symbol in Hinduism. The ongkara script is used in the life of the Hindu community in Bali as a symbol for symbolizes Ida Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa. Religious value can be seen from the lotus flower motif which is a symbol of spirituality, seen from the place where the lotus flower grows in three media/three different levels of nature, namely soil (mud), water, and air. The roots and tubers grow creeping in the mud at the bottom of the water, the stems grow in the water, and the leaves and flowers float above the surface of the water. In Hinduism, the characters of these three levels of nature are called Tri Loka. The Tri Loka are the three levels of the universe consisting of Bhur-Loka, Bvah-Loka and Svah-Loka. Mud is interpreted as a symbol of the Bhur-Loka realm (the human realm), water is equated with the Bvah-Loka realm (the transitional realm), and air is equated with the Svah-Loka realm (the divine realm). The lotus flower grows in dirty mud water, but that does not reduce the beauty of the lotus flower, even the lotus flower will make the dirty environment beautiful. This is also related to the concept of Hinduism, namely Tri Hita Karana. Tri Hita Karana is a philosophy of life that has a concept that can preserve culture and the environment. In Hindu society, they tend to see themselves and their environment as a system that is controlled by the value of balance. The basic concept of Tri Hita Karana is the basic concept of human relations in life in this world. Tri Hita Karana describes 1) human relationship with Ida Hyang Widhi Wasa or God, 2) human relationship with pawongan or fellow human beings, and 3) with palemahan or human relationship with the environment.\n\nThe work entitled Mandala Yoga\nValue of Character Education 1. Nilai Religious a. Decorative form of people who are meditating/yoga. Decorative forms of people who are meditating/yoga can be manifested as Lord Vishnu. Under this ascetic, his form is described as that of the Garuda bird, where the Garuda bird is the mount of Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu is called a manifestation of God in his duties as caretaker, Lord Vishnu's mount is the Garuda bird as depicted in the work. Lord Vishnu is one of the manifestations of God to protect nature and its contents which is called Tri Murti. Tri Murti consists of 3 gods, namely, Lord Brahma whose job is as creator, Lord Vishnu whose job is as a caretaker, and Lord Shiva whose job is as a fuser. Each of these gods has a magician or wife as a source of energy or power to rule. The manifestation of God as Sang Hyang Tri Murti is worshiped at the kahyangan tiga temples located in each traditional village (pekraman village) in Bali. The poleng motif in the work can be described as Rwa Bhineda. Rwa bhineda is a dualistic concept in Balinese culture, namely two opposite categories that are always close together, both of which originate from one thing, for example hot and cold, day and night. Rwa bhineda is generally depicted in black and white, but in Widya Harsana's batik works, it is made by pouring red and blue colors. The colors red and blue have different characters, namely red is a hot color character while blue is a cold color character. This motif has a philosophy of darkness and light in this life, there are good and bad, there is day and night.\n\nb. Motive poleng\nc. Motive flower  The mandala motif in the work is interpreted as the concentration of the mind during meditation. Inside the mandala motif there is an image of the ongkara script, the ongkara script is a sacred symbol in Hinduism. The ongkara script is used in the life of the Hindu community in Bali as a symbol to represent Ida Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa or God Almighty. The mandala motif, which contains the ongkara script, can be interpreted as focusing the mind on God Almighty during meditation.  This motif is a motive by linking one motive with another. Each motif has a religious meaning and this motif symbolizes peace.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe character education values contained in the batik motifs in the title Mandala Yoga are religious values, environmental care values, creative values and peace-loving values. The batik work entitled Lotus Flower has an educational value of religious character and the value of caring for the environment.\n\nSuggestion\nIn accordance with the research objectives to be achieved, the suggestions to be recommended is batik motifs need to be developed so that batik motifs vary. Batik motifs should be designed using symbols so that the batik motifs are meaningful."

              "The Effect of Praying on Endogenous Pain Modulation and Pain Intensity in Healthy Religious Individuals in Lebanon: A Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nPrayer is considered to be the most common therapy used in alternative medicine. This study aimed to explore the effect of prayers on endogenous pain modulation, pain intensity, and sensitivity in healthy religious participants. A total of 208 healthy religious participants were enrolled in this study and randomly distributed into two groups, a prayer group (n = 156) and a poem reading or control group (n = 52). Participants from the prayer group were then selectively allocated using the prayer function scale to either an active prayer group (n = 94) receiving an active type of praying or to a passive prayer group (n = 62) receiving a passive type of praying. Pain assessments were performed before and following the interventions and included pressure pain threshold assessment (PPT), conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and a numerical pain rating scale. A significant group-by-time interaction for PPT (p = 0.014) indicated post-intervention increases in PPT in the prayer group but not in the poem reading control group. Participants experienced a decrease in CPM efficacy (p = 0.030) and a reduction in their NPRS (p < 0.001) following the interventions, independent of their group allocation. The results showed that prayer, irrespective of the type, can positively affect pain sensitivity and intensity, but does not influence endogenous pain inhibition during hot water immersion. Future research should focus on understanding the mechanism behind “prayer-induced analgesia.”\n\n\nIntroduction\nReligion can be defined as a \"Sentiment of learned behaviors and social expressions that reflect cultural values\" (White et al., 2011). Prayers, religious activities, and seeking spiritual guidance all refer to religion (Tzeng & Yin, 2008;Wachholtz et al., 2007). Religion is also defined as a belief system, a connection with the divine being, a relationship with the supernatural, and a philosophy (Narayanasamy, 2004). Religiosity can be divided into three major dimensions (Levin et al., 1995). The first dimension comprises organizational religious activity (ORA), which reflects the social dimension of religiousness and includes attending church, synagogue, and taking part in prayer or Bible study groups. The second dimension of religiosity is the non-organizational religious activity (NORA), and it comprises more private and personal religious behaviors such as prayer, meditation, reading the Bible, or other religious literature. The final and third dimension is subjective or intrinsic religiosity (IR), and it reflects the extent to which religion is the primary motivating factor in people's lives and how it influences decision-making and behavior (Koenig et al., 2004).\nPrayer is considered the most common alternative medicine therapy (South & McDowell, 2018;Tippens et al., 2009). In pain management, traditional strategies do not always ease pain or improve quality of life, leading to alternative pain relief approaches (Breivik et al., 2006). Previous studies showed that prayer for self (43%) and prayer for others (24.4%) as being two of the most used alternative medicine practices in the USA (Barnes et al., 2004) and that the inclusion of prayer in the definition of alternative and complementary medicine resulted in a significant increase in its usage (Robles et al., 2017). Recently, researchers showed interest in understanding the role of spirituality on pain experience (Ferreira-Valente et al., 2019;Illueca & Doolittle, 2020;O'Beirne et al., 2020) based on the need for a model that incorporates spirituality in the biopsychosocial frame of pain (Wachholtz A.B. et al., 2007). However, many of these studies identify prayer as a coping mechanism and do not focus on the therapeutic effect of prayer in pain management. In addition, one can also distinguish different forms of prayer (Laird et al., 2004): adoration, confession, thanksgiving, reception, and supplication defined also as petitionary prayer (Poloma & Pendleton, 1991).\nThe current study focuses on supplication or petitionary prayer, which is a specific request for (a) oneself or (b) others (Jors et al., 2015). The praying ritual is structured as follows: a motive to pray (a problem), an action to perform (ask something), and an effect to be sought (the solution to the problem). Depending on the individual's relationship with God, we can distinguish 3 methods of problem-solving or 3 methods of praying to address a problem (K. Pargament & Mahoney, 2005;Pargament et al., 1988). In the first type, known as \"self-directing,\" the individual is very active, and God is passive, giving people the freedom and resources to direct their own life. The second type describes a style in which the individual takes no active steps and passively waits for God to solve the problem known as \"deferring.\" The third type describes a pattern of coping in which the individual and God both take active roles, in partnership with each other, to solve a problem known as \"collaborative\" (Pargament et al., 1988). While the deferring type represents a passive type of prayer and coping, the collaborative and self-directing types represent a more active type of prayer and coping.\nBiologically, there are multiple potential pathways through which prayer may affect pain modulation (Seybold, 2007). Spiritual/religious activities are associated with an increase in serotonin levels (Mohandas, 2008). This raises the possibility that the serotonin system, which plays an important role in endogenous pain modulation through the facilitatory and inhibitory pathways, serves as a biological basis for spiritual experiences (Borg et al., 2003). Besides, prayer and other religious practices such as meditation activate various brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate (Neubauer, 2014). The mPFC is important for pain processing and its involvement in the modulation of pain catastrophizing (Seminowicz & Davis, 2006), reduction of pain-induced sympathetic activity (Perlaki et al., 2015), and decrease in facial expressions of pain (Karmann et al., 2016). Previous studies (Jegindø et al., 2013;Wiech et al., 2008) have demonstrated that religious participants perceived painful stimulation as less intense after prayer or after meditating over religious images. In addition, an active style of prayer and in contrast to passive prayer is associated with greater pain tolerance for participants with religious beliefs undergoing an experimental painful procedure (Meints et al., 2018). However, none of these studies investigated the effect of prayer on endogenous analgesia.\nMore research should reveal if prayers affect endogenous pain modulation. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) has recently been coined for the psychophysical protocols that assess the functioning of descending pain inhibitory pathways in humans and could thus assess the effect of prayer on endogenous pain modulation. Besides, pressure pain threshold (PPT) assessments are a way of quantifying the sensitivity of deep structures to mechanical pain (Balaguier et al., 2016b). PPT provides a quantitative value related to deep structures sensitivity, allowing researchers to make comparisons over time (Balaguier et al., 2016a), and could be used to evaluate the effect of prayer on pain sensitivity.\nThe primary purpose of this study was to explore the effect of petitionary praying on endogenous pain modulation. It was hypothesized that prayer would increase PPTs, CPM efficacy, and reduce pain intensity during painful hot water immersion compared to a no-prayer control group in a healthy religious population. The secondary purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different types of praying on pain outcomes since the style of praying has been shown to affect health outcomes in different ways. For instance, active prayers are associated with better mental health outcomes than passive prayers (Bade & Cook, 2008;Tait et al., 2016). Therefore, it was hypothesized that participants engaging in active prayer would show greater improvements in pain outcomes compared to those engaging in passive prayer.\n\nDesign Overview and Setting\nThe experiment trial took place from October 2020 to February 2021 in Rehabzone clinic, a rehabilitation clinic affiliated with the physical therapy department of Antonine University in Lebanon. The local ethics committees from Antonine University approved the trial. All participants signed informed consent. The full study protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04614272.). In the present paper, the effects of two types of prayer (active and passive) versus a control condition (poem reading), on CPM, PPT, and pain intensity rated on a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) in healthy religious university students are reported. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and directly after the intervention. The trial is reported following the CONSORT guidelines (http:// www. conso rtsta tement. org). Since the study was performed during the Covid-19 outbreak, a hygiene policy was adopted to ensure the safety of the participants and the assessors.\n\nStudy Design\nThe present study is a double-blind randomized controlled experiment. The study participants were blinded to the study hypothesis, and the therapist collecting the data was also blinded to the randomization sequence.\n\nStudy Population and Sample Size\nHealthy Christian and Muslim male and female participants were recruited through different sources: Flyers distributed at the Antonine University and Rehabzone clinic, emails sent to the Antonine University students, and adverts on social media. People interested to take part in the study were asked to fill out an online questionnaire that screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were Lebanese English-speaking students aged between 18 and 25 and with a minimum score of at least two over six on the second question from the Duke University Religion Index (DUREL): \"How often do you spend time in private religious activities, such as prayer, meditation, or Bible study?\" the scores were from one (rarely or never) to six with (more than once a day) (Koenig & Büssing, 2010). This question was chosen from the DURELL since it reflects the NORA and it helped to define the religious activities performed by the participants in private, such as prayer. Subjects who scored low in religiosity (< two/six) were excluded from the study. Subjects were also excluded in case of regular use of medication, pregnancy, severe allergic reactions, systemic, neurological, metabolic, cardiovascular pathologies, chronic pain, psychiatric disease (being under pharmacological or psychiatric treatment), or suffering from hypertension (> 140/90 mm Hg) (Chalaye et al., 2013). People meeting the criteria were called to set up an appointment.\nTo minimize the risk of bias, confounding variables affecting both the autonomic and the central nervous systems were controlled. While scheduling appointments, participants were asked to consume a light meal must no later than two hours (heavy meals no later than four hours) before the initiation of the experiments (Anjana & Reetu, 2014;Zmarzty et al., 1997) and requested to refrain from physical exertion 24 h before the experiments (Flood et al., 2017;Lemley et al., 2015;Lima et al., 2017;Stolzman & Bement, 2016), to abstain from analgesic medications 48 h before the experiments (Niesters et al., 2013), and to refrain from smoking (Ditre et al., 2016;Perkins et al., 1994), alcohol (Horn-Hofmann et al., 2019), and caffeine (Sawynok, 2011) in the two hours before the experiments. On the day of the experiments, participants were questioned regarding their adherence to these requests.\n\nSample Size and randomization\nThe sample size needed for this study was calculated using the software program G*Power 3.1. To detect an average effect size (f = 0.25) based on Cohen's conventional standards for the interpretation of effect sizes (Cohen, 2013) with a power of P = 0.8 and a significance threshold of α = 0.05 using a one-way between-subject ANOVA, a total sample size of 159 individuals was warranted, with 53 individuals per group (active prayer group, passive prayer group, poem control group) (Faul et al., 2007).\n\nRandomization\nRandomization of the 208 participants was performed using a permuted block allocation (block size of four) with 52 blocks and a ratio of 3:1, with three being the prayer group and one representing the control (poem) group. Unequal randomization was used to allocate the participants to an intervention (prayer) or control group (poem). Selective allocation was later used to allocate the participants into an active or passive prayer group based on the style of praying. However, unequal randomization has consequences for statistical power and a 3:1 randomization scheme requires 33% more patients (Hey & Kimmelman, 2014). Therefore, a total sample size of 208 participants was required to provide adequate power for the analyses.\n\nStyle of Praying\nAll participants filled out a self-reported questionnaire called \"the prayer function scale\" (PFS) which describes ways that people use prayer to deal with personal difficulties (Bade & Cook, 2008). The PFS helped to identify the style of praying (Bade & Cook, 2008). It is a self-report instrument that assesses the motivation or purpose behind an individual's prayer, while she or he is coping with difficult circumstances. This scale comprises 58 items that are scored on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from one (almost never) to five (a great deal), and it is divided into four scales: provides acceptance (17 items), provides calm, and focus (11 items), deferring/ avoiding (16 items), and provides assistance (14 items). While the deferring/avoiding scale represents a passive type of prayer and coping, the assistance scale represents an active type of prayer and coping. The PFS deferring/avoiding scale and the assistance scale were used to allocate participants from the prayer group into, respectively, a passive or an active prayer group.\n\nIntervention\nWhile the \"deferring/avoiding\" group was given a script for a passive type of praying, the \"ask for assistance group\" was given a script for an active type of praying. The two types of prayers were inspired by the PFS (Bade & Cook, 2008). The passive prayer script (i.e., \"Please God, take the pain away\") was inspired by the questions in the PFS related to the deferring/avoiding style, and the script for the active prayer (i.e., \"Please God, help me endure this pain\") was inspired from the PFS questions related to the ask for assistance style of praying. The control group received the script of a poem and was asked to read this (i.e., \"The earth is our home, so blue and so green, let's do our part to keep the earth clean''). The poem was chosen to be emotionless, to avoid the psychophysiological responses related to a poetry reading (Wassiliwizky et al., 2017). All three groups received the instructions and scripts on a piece of paper and were asked to repeat the prayer or the poem for a duration of three minutes. The instructions read: \"In the next three minutes you are asked to repeat the following sentence, during which you can choose your preferred posture (sitting, standing, or kneeling).\"\n\nOutcome Measures\nOutcome measures were PPT, CPM, and NPRS assessed before and directly following the intervention. Sociodemographic data such as religious affiliation, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hand dominance, smoking, alcohol intake, caffeine intake, and physical activity level were also collected at baseline using a selfreported questionnaire. In addition, the DUREL, which is a five-item self-report measure of religious involvement, was used to assess the religiosity level. It assesses the three major dimensions of religiosity: ORA, NORA, and IR (Koenig & Büssing, 2010).\n\nPPT\nPPT assessment is considered a reliable method for measuring mechanical pain thresholds (Cathcart & Pritchard, 2006). PPTs were assessed in a sitting position using a digital algometer (FPX 50, Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, USA) unilaterally (at the side of the dominant hand) at two different body sites. The investigator applied the pressure in a perpendicular direction relative to the muscle while increasing the force at a rate of one kg/ / s until the participant said to stop when the sensation became intolerable. The pressure marked at that moment was determined as the PPT, measured in kg/cm 2 . The first location was the trapezius belly, with PPTs being assessed at mid-distance between the acromion and the spinous process of the seven cervical vertebrae (Salavati et al., 2017). The trapezius muscle is a reliable test location for measuring the PPT (Persson et al., 2004). The second location was on the calf belly, with PPTs being measured at the proximal one-third of the calf (Giesbrecht & Battié, 2005;Meeus et al., 2010). The PPT was taken at each of the two anatomical sites with an interval of 30 s until the circuit was repeated a total of two times, starting with the trapezius as the first measurement and then proceeding with the measurement of the calf (Bisset et al., 2015). The time between two PPT measures of the same body location was enough to prevent the pain wind-up effect that might be induced by temporal summation (Cathcart et al., 2009). Four PPT measurements were taken, from which a mean PPT was calculated using the following formula: (PPT calf 1 + PPT calf 2 + PPT trapezius 1 + PPT trapezius 2) / 4.\n\nCPM\nConditioning stimulus (CS). The CS consisted of thermal, hot water stimulation of the non-dominant hand. Participants were comfortably seated next to a water bath and instructed to immerse the non-dominant in hot water for one minute. The temperature water of 45,5 °C, was achieved using an immersion circulator (Immersion Circulator LX, Polyscience, Illinois, USA). The temperature of 45,5 °C has been shown to elicit a robust CPM effect, without potential ceiling or floor effects (Nir et al., 2011(Nir et al., , 2012. A line was drawn 10 cm proximally of the wrist crease marking until where the hand needs to be immersed, to ensure whole-hand immersion. Participants were instructed to keep their hands still and unclenched and motivated to complete one full minute of hand immersion. Participants could see a countdown timer of the immersed time. If the participant could not complete the entire one minute, the duration of immersion was recorded. Previous research has shown fair to excellent reliability for the use of a hot noxious water bath as a CS (Kennedy et al., 2016).\nTest stimulus (TS). The TS existed of mechanical pain stimulation applied using algometry and assessed by determining the PPT. Therefore, PPTs were taken prior to and following the application of the CS as described in the section PPT. The use of PPT has been validated as a proper TS for measuring CPM (Klyne et al., 2015). It has been shown that CPM is still active five minutes after the removal of the CS in studies using experimental pain (France & Suchowiecki, 1999;Motohashi & Umino, 2001) and argued that the purest CPM effect is obtained by measuring immediately following the CS (i.e., sequential) and not during (i.e., parallel) (Yarnitsky et al., 2015). In line with this recommendation, a sequential CPM paradigm protocol was used.\nThe CPM outcome score was calculated using the following formula: average of the two consecutive PPTs per location following CS-the average of the two consecutive PPTs per location before the CS (i.e., (T1 (PPT1 trapezius + PPT2 trapezius + PPT1 calf + PPT2 calf)/4)-(T0 (PPT1 trapezius + PPT2 trapezius + PPT1 calf + PPT2 calf)/4)). Hence, higher CPM values reflect better functioning of endogenous pain inhibition. The CPM protocol was repeated before and following the intervention (prayer or poem reading). The post-intervention CPM protocol took place at least 10 min after the pre-intervention or baseline CPM protocol to ensure wash-out of the CPM effect (France & Suchowiecki, 1999;Motohashi & Umino, 2001). The intervention was delivered during the 10-min break, each participant moved to another room to practice either three minutes of active praying, passive praying, or three minutes of poetry reading.\n\nNPRS\nPain intensity for thermal hot water stimulation was evaluated using a NPRS from 0 to 100, with 0 referring to \"no pain\" and 100 to \"maximal pain\" felt. It was assessed after the first 30 s of immersion and once more immediately after removing the CS.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS version 2.6 (IBM, New York, USA). The normality of the data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Descriptive analyses were used to present the sociodemographic and clinical group characteristics, which were described for the control and prayer group as a whole, and separate for the active prayer group and the passive prayer group. Mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile, and confidence intervals were calculated for the description of continuous variables, whereas frequencies and percentages were calculated for the categorical variables. To evaluate differences in sociodemographic features between all groups, the Chi-square was used for categorical variables, the Kruskal-Wallis was used for the continuous variables with non-normal data distribution, and the Mann-Whitney was used for the continuous variables with normal data distribution. The presence of CPM effects before the intervention was examined using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the PPT post-conditioning vs. pre-conditioning.\nTo answer the first research question which evaluated the effect of prayer on PPT, CPM, and NPRS compared to the poetry reading in religious individuals, linear mixed models (LMM) were constructed to test for mean differences between groups (prayer vs control) with the factors \"time\" (pre, post) and \"group\" (prayer, control). To answer the second research question which evaluated the effect of two types of prayer (active, passive) on PPT, CPM, and NPRS compared to a poetry reading in religious individuals, LMMs were constructed to test for mean differences between three groups (active, passive, control), with the factors \"time\" (pre, post) and \"group\" (active, passive, control). The residuals of the LMMs were checked for normal distribution. When required, post hoc pairwise comparisons were taken using a Bonferroni correction. An intervention-by-time interaction for fixed effects and a main effect for the factor time were analyzed, and random intercept for subject was included to account for within-subject variability. Statistical significance was accepted at a p level of 0.050. Imbalances in demographic data were considered covariates and were included in the analysis.\n\nParticipant Characteristics\nThe participant flow diagram reflected in Fig. 1 shows the number of total responders and participants who were assessed for eligibility, and those who were randomized and underwent allocated intervention and measurements for each group. A total of 208 religious individuals (age range, 17-25 years) took part in the study. While 156 participants were allocated to the prayer group, 52 were allocated to the control group. Within the prayer group, 94 subjects (62%) were allocated to the active prayer group, whereas 62 individuals (38%) were allocated to the passive prayer group in line with the results of the PFS. All participants reported having performed the prayer or read the poem in a sitting position.\n\nDid not meet inclusion criteria (n=791)\nDurel ( Assessed for eligibility (n=1167) Fig. 1 CONSORT flow diagram that shows the number of total responders and participants who were assessed for eligibility, and those who were randomized and underwent allocated intervention and measurements for each group\n\nGroup Differences over Sociodemographic Variables\nThere was a significant difference in alcohol consumption (p = 0.010) between the two groups (prayer and control), whereas significant imbalances between the three groups (active prayer, passive prayer, and control) were observed for age (p = 0.027), religion (p = 0.025), and alcohol consumption (p = 0.022). These imbalances were included as covariates in the LMM analyses. The three groups showed no differences in the NORA (p = 0.434). Demographic features of the prayer and control group are summarized in Table 1, whereas features of the active prayer, passive prayer, and control are represented in Table 2.\n\nCPM effect\nThe results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank assessing the occurrence of the CPM effect before the intervention showed that the CS elicits a significant change in the average PPT before the intervention (Z = − 4.29, p< 0.001) which indicates the overall presence of a CPM effect. Looking at individual responses, 128 participants out of 208 participants (61.5%) showed an increase in the PPT following CS indicating that they were CPM responders, while 80 participants (38.5%) were considered to be non-responders.\n\nEffects of prayer versus control on PPT, CPP, and NPRS\nDescriptive statistics of PPT, CPM, and NPRS for the data related to the first research question are shown in Table 3. PPT The LMM analysis showed a significant group-by-time interaction for PPT (p = 0.014). Post hoc pairwise comparisons showed a significant increase in the PPT after the intervention in the prayer group (p < 0.001) (mean difference (MD): 1.806; 95% CI, 1.357 to 2.25) which was not the case for the control or poem group (p = 0.085) (MD: 0.682; 95% CI, − 0.95 to 1.460).\nCPM No significant group-by-time interaction effects were found for CPM (p > 0.050). However, a significant main effect for time was observed (p = 0.030). Participants presented a drop in their CPM scores following the intervention ((EM mean post-intervention 1.058; 95% CI, 0.198 to 1.919; EM mean pre-intervention 1.440; 95% CI, 0.579 to 2.301) regardless of being in the prayer or the control group.\nNPRS No significant group-by-time interaction effects were found for NPRS (p > 0.050). However, a significant main effect for time was shown (p < 0.001). Participants experienced a drop in their NPRS scores following the intervention (EM mean post-intervention 28.96; 95% CI, 14.416 to 43.49; EM mean pre-intervention 38.049; 95% CI, 52.59 to 23.51) independent of the group which they were in.

More than once/ week 6 (6.4%) 4 (6.5%) 5 (9.6%) PPT The LMM analysis showed a significant group-by-time interaction for PPT (p = 0.005). Bonferroni post hoc analyses for group-by-time interaction effects revealed a significant increase in the PPT following the active prayer intervention (p < 0.001) (MD 2.21; 95% CI, 1.63 to 2.78) and the passive prayer intervention (p = 0.001) (MD: 1.2; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.9), compared to the control intervention (p = 0.082) (MD: 0.682; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.45). There was no significant difference (p = 0.165) between the active (EM mean 16.45) and the passive prayer group (EM mean 14.84). The differences between the active prayer group and the control group (EM mean 15.13) did also not reach statistical significance (p = 0.400). All results can be found in Table 5.\nCPM No significant group-by-time interaction effects were found for CPM (p > 0.050). However, a significant main effect for time was shown (p = 0.030). Participants experienced a reduction in CPM scores following the intervention (EM mean post-intervention 0.968; 95% CI, 0.088 to 1.848; EM mean pre-intervention 1.350; 95% CI, 0.470 to 2.23) independent of their group allocation.\nNPRS No significant group-by-time interaction effects were found for NPRS (p > 0.050). However, a significant main effect for time was established (p < 0.001). Participants experienced a reduction in NPRS scores following the intervention (EM mean post-intervention 30.82; 95% CI, 15.99 to 45.65; EM mean pre-intervention 39.92; 95% CI, 25.08 to 54.74), regardless of the group they were in.\n\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed at investigating the pain modulating effect of prayer in a sample of healthy religious individuals. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effect of prayer on mechanical pain sensitivity, endogenous pain modulation, and pain intensity compared to poem reading. It was hypothesized that engaging in prayer would lead to increases in PPT and CPM efficacy, and a decrease in NPRS, while no prayer would not induce any changes, and that these increases would be greater following active prayer than when engaging in passive prayer. The findings provide some support for these hypotheses. Concerning mechanical pain sensitivity, results showed a significant increase in PPT over time in the prayer groups, regardless of the type of prayer, and this effect was not present in the poem reading control group. However, when the types of prayer were compared to each other or with the poem reading control group, statistics did not reach significance.\nRegarding endogenous pain modulation, and in contrast to our hypotheses, both prayer groups and the poem reading control group showed a decrease in CPM efficacy following the intervention. Their effects were similar between groups. To explain the reduced CPM following the intervention, several hypotheses can be proposed: (1) The decrease in CPM efficacy could be explained by the use of a fixed and not an adapted conditioning paradigm. Previous studies (Nir et al., 2011;Oono et al., 2011) showed that CPM could be intensity-dependent and thus an increase in the intensity of the CS would induce better CPM results. Prior studies also showed a decreased CPM efficacy during a second CPM testing (Coppieters et al., 2016;Meeus et al., 2015). It may be that each successive conditioned noxious stimulus decreases CPM efficacy. Coppieters et al. (2016) investigated the effect of relaxation on CPM in chronic whiplash and fibromyalgia patients compared to healthy controls and found a decreased CPM efficacy in the three groups after the intervention, regardless of the type of intervention. (2) It may be that the 10-min break maintained between the two CS could not have been enough to avoid a carry-over effect; therefore, a longer recovery period may be necessary after a previous CPM activation. It is possible that adequate CPM activation after the intervention was affected by all of these factors. (3) Additionally, it could be that prayer and CPM do not rely on the same mechanisms. Pain modulation through religious prayer like mindfulness meditation (Zeidan et al., 2016) seems to rely on non-opioidergic systems (Elmholdt  et al., 2017) which suggests the involvement of a non-opioidergic cognitive pain modulation system and the notion of multiple pathways in pain control independent of descending inhibitory mechanisms. Therefore, it was hypothesized that prayers and CPM might rely on different mechanisms and do not reinforce each other. Regarding pain intensity, NPRS findings for both prayer groups and the poetry reading control group resulted in a significant decrease in scores over time, with no significant differences between groups. The decrease in the poem group could be explained by the distraction from hot water, causing pain by focusing on reading the poem. Distraction is an effective approach to reducing pain (Bukola & Paula, 2017).\nAs expected, and in line with earlier studies (Elmholdt et al., 2017;Meints et al., 2018), results showed that prayer decreases pain sensation for religious individuals regardless of the type of prayer. Active prayers are related to better health when compared to passive prayers (Bade & Cook, 2008;Tait et al., 2016), and active praying is considered an active or self-management approach to pain, while passive praying is considered a passive style of coping. However, in our study, there were no significant differences between the two styles of praying on pain sensitivity.\nAlthough the exact underlying mechanisms are unclear, several hypotheses may explain how prayer reduces pain. Previous studies showed that the cognitive activity of positive re-appraisal mediated the relationship between prayer and pain. Positive reappraisal involves cognitively reframing an event as more positive or valuable allowing individuals to adapt successfully to stressful life events (Garland et al., 2009). Also, other theories have been elaborated, such as conscious re-appraisal, which can alter the meaning of pain without targeting the sensory aspects of the percept (Woo et al., 2015). Other studies (Elmholdt et al., 2017;Jegindø et al., 2013) highlighted the power of strong expectations driven by beliefs and previous religious coping experiences to explain ''religion-induced analgesia.''\n\nStrength, Limitations, and Future Research\nThe present study has several strengths. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to investigate the effect of prayer on CPM. Participants were blinded to the study objectives, and the assessor of the outcome measures was blinded to the intervention allocation. However, when interpreting the results, some limitations must be considered. First, all participants were young and pain-free; thus, the findings cannot be generalized to all ages or individuals suffering from pain conditions. In addition, the prayer was not personalized, which could have reduced its meaning and effects. Future research is needed on the analgesic effect of praying in which it would be necessary to personalize the experiment by allowing the participant to pray in their way to reduce the pain and then allocate them to an active or a passive group, according to their style of praying. Moreover, research should focus on extending the follow-up period to observe the long-term effects of \"religious induced analgesia.'' Furthermore, it would be interesting to inventory expectations and previous religious coping experiences, to examine how these potentially influence the results. Also, subjects were selectively allocated using the prayer function scale to either an active prayer group or to a passive prayer group, rather than being randomly allocated; self-selection bias may have affected the results.\n\nConclusion\nThe results suggest that prayer, regardless of the used style, reduces mechanical pain sensitivity and self-reported pain intensity in a healthy religious population. Endogenous pain modulation, assessed using a CPM paradigm, decreased in response to both prayer and poem reading, indicating that CPM and praying probably rely on different mechanisms which do not interact."

              "INCLUSIVE CLIMATE AND THE PERFORMANCE OF EMPLOYEES FROM MUSLIM DIASPORA IN THE WESTERN ORGANISATIONS\n\nThis exploratory study focuses on the impact of inclusive organisational climate on the members of Muslim diaspora in the Western workforce. There are theories and evidence that view increasing diversity in the workforce as a positive rather than a negative phenomenon. This is one of the few research papers that exclusively focuses on the implications of inclusive management practices for Muslim employees in the Western organisations. Evidence from the Muslim employees working in different industrial sectors in Australia, New Zealand, United States\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Muslim diaspora in the Western economy is a topic of social interest and yet remains a rarely explored subject in extant business literature. The unique representation of workers from different Muslim cultural origins in a sharply contrasting Western work setting deserves some special attention due to persisting challenges faced by this subculture with multiple identities, legal pluralism, cultural continuities (Afshar et al., 2005;Grillo, 2004), and so forth. Out of the total population of 7.3 billion in the world, Muslim population is around 1.8 billion (United Nations, 2015). Muslim community is not a single homogeneous group, rather they come from different socioeconomic stratum in the world. The heterogeneous group of Muslim population migrating to Western countries from different cultural origin constitutes Muslim diaspora in the Western workforce. The gravity of the so-called \"Islamophobia\" in the West has further extended the importance of focusing on the strategic advantages of inclusive management practices in the Western organisations.\nThis study examines the impact of inclusive management practices on the attitude and performance of members of Muslim diaspora working in the Western advanced economies. Evidence from the Muslim employees working in different industries in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Canada, and United States have been used to explore the positive organisational outcomes propositioned by the growing Muslim community in the Western workplace. The findings should help the management practitioners develop a different strategic perspective about the growing tension between increasing Islamophobia in the Western culture and the necessity of inclusion of the fast-growing Muslim population in the Western economy and workforce (Moghissi & Ghorashi, 2016). This study is informed by a key research question: What inclusive management practices are perceived desirable and useful by members of the Muslim diaspora in the Western organisations and why? The study also aims to explore how inclusive climate may influence the attitudinal and behavioural outcomes of the Muslim employees in a Western work environment. This paper is organised in six major sections. First, the social exchange theory has been explored as the theoretical foundation underpinning this study. Second, the concept of diaspora has been explored with a specific focus on Muslim diaspora to highlight the literature gap. Third, the concepts of diversity and benefits of inclusiveness have been discussed. Fourth, the methodology of the study has been explained. Fifth, the major findings from the interview schedule have been presented and discussed, and finally, a conclusion has been drawn with an implication for management practitioners and future researchers.\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\nSocial exchange theory underpins the interactive relationships between employees and the organisation (see Twenge et al., 2008;Kataria et al., 2013). According to social exchange theory, the goal of human behaviour in organisation is to maximise rewards and minimise costs. The foundation of social exchange theory is employee engagement (Yin, 2018). If employees believe that their work behaviour generates expected outcome that in turn motivates and engages them in the expected work behaviour (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2010). The reward, respect, justice, and resources offered by the organisation help create employees' trust toward their organisation and increase their job performance (Masterson & Taylor, 2000).\nSocial exchange theory can explain why an inclusive organisational climate may be reciprocated (or expected to be reciprocated) by the representatives of Muslim diaspora in the Western workforce by positive attitudes and behaviours. The three fundamental ideas of social exchange theory, i.e., expectations of reciprocity, resources exchanged, and relationship that emerge (Hom et al., 2009;Penrose, 1995;Shore & Barksdale, 1998) have also been used to predict and explain the reciprocity effect of return on inclusive management practices explored in this study. Social exchange theory is the theoretical foundation of this research.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW The Concept of Muslim Diaspora\nThe word \"diaspora\" has a Greek origin which means \"scattering of seeds\" or \"dispersion.\" This word was widely used to refer to the dispersion or forced migration of Jews throughout the world (http://www.answers.com/topic/diaspora). Until the late 1960s, the concept of diaspora was exclusively applied to the historical cases, but new forms of diasporas came into existence with new waves of migration, new technologies of communication, and the abandonment of strict integration policies by many nation-states. In recent years, the word diaspora has popularly been used to describe and analyse the political conversation of American Muslims. It means how American Muslims are constantly redefining their identity as a community in the United States, and at the same time, how they are readjusting to American society and the Islamic world (Schumann, 2007). Safran (1991) defined diaspora as an expatriate minority community whose members share some common characteristics. His definition has some flexibility as he identified six characteristics and mentioned that a particular diaspora may contain several of those characteristics and not necessarily all of them. His definition views a diaspora as a unique group of people dispersed from their land of origin to two or more foreign regions and they retain a collective memory, vision, or myth about their original homeland. This group may feel partly alienated and insulated from the dominant host society and they continue to regard their ancestral homeland as their true, ideal home and the future home of their descendants. They believe that they should, collectively, be committed to the maintenance or restoration of their original homeland and they continue to relate to that homeland and their ethnocommunal consciousness and solidarity are crucially demarcated by the existence of such a relationship. In line with Safran's theory (1991), Shain and Barth (2003) have defined diaspora as people who reside, somewhat on a permanent basis, outside the borders of their ethnic or religious homeland. However, most scholars agreed that diasporas are not alike and their different histories, generations of exit, their cultures and trajectories mark them out as rather unique (Baser & Swain, 2008).\nThese definitions of \"diaspora\" indicate that the members of a diaspora may devotedly try to retain their originality by holding on to the root culture in its point of dispersion. This also implies that the diaspora will emerge as a unique segment trying to retain the memory or vision of their homeland, while their home of origin may have moved forward away from traditional culture of the homeland. Therefore, a diaspora tends to protest cultural assimilation to their host community while they fail to keep pace with the homeland culture. This should make this collection of individuals a unique social entity with an interesting set of perceptions and demands. These groups may be dispersed to different host countries with diverged socioeconomic and cultural context and yet hold a common platform of vision and myth of their original homeland and the dream of returning to their root when the situation there (origin) is changed in future.\nAll the characteristics of a diaspora may essentially apply to Muslim diaspora in the Western advanced economies with their unique set of religious, cultural, ritualistic, and historical origins. Rahnema (2006) and Albrecht et al. (2016) identified \"triple identity\" (religious, original national, and new national) and Schumann (2007) highlighted on the \"twofold\" affiliation of Muslim population in West to explore the uniqueness of this subculture. Saint-Blancat (2002, p. 149) explained this intricacy as follows: The affirmation of the diaspora is both an exercise in critical distancing and a reappropriation of a collective and individual self … In the long term, everything depends on their desire and capacity to ensure the juxtaposition of the continuity of their descent with the imperative of change … The difficulties are not born of the fluid, pragmatic management of space that is reflected in the variety of strategies for integration into different European societies. Rather, they are difficulties linked to the development of a flexible category of belonging, capable of taking into account plural dynamics of identity, still far from a religious communitarianism that might try to compensate for an incomplete sociability. Beyond the necessary institutional representation, the Muslim diaspora also needs, in order to be structured, a logic of inclusion that ensures its members of the mutual recognition of a legitimate right to be Muslim in several ways.\nA complex sense of collectiveness based on religious identity despite the root scattering from different lands of origin makes the Muslim diaspora in the west even more interesting to study and rather challenging to include in the Western work culture.\n\nDiversity and Inclusiveness: Benefits and Challenges\nWorkplace inclusion and diversity are conceptualised differently in the business literature. Inclusion environment provides respect and equitable opportunities leading to organisational success (Panicker et al., 2018) where individuals feel like an important part of the organisation through equal and unbiased access to information and feel connected to co-workers and effectively engage in the decision-making process irrespective of their uniqueness (Mor Barak, 2011). Inclusive climate also ensures the full participation and contribution of employees in organisations through removing obstacles (Roberson, 2006). Inclusive practices make sure that all members of the organisation feel accepted and involved in the decision-making process, get equally treated in the conflict resolution strategies, and experience unbiased behaviour (Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998;Nishii, 2010). By the same token, inclusive management refers to the word and action of the managers that invite and encourage contributions from a diverged group of employees (Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006). Inclusive management practices essentially have positive effects on majority team members through empowerment in the workplace (Pelled, 1996). The reasons of positive effect of such inclusive practices are the perceived autonomy, information sharing, and increased engagement among the members of the organisation. An inclusive climate can also ensure a better person-organisation match, reduced stress, involved decision making, and improved communication flow (Seibert et al., 2004;Maslach, 1999;Kezar, 2001;Butts et al., 2009).\nAn inclusive climate consists of policies, procedures, and actions of organisational agents that create unbiased climate and system for all social groups with especial attention to the underprivileged groups (Panicker et al., 2018). Inclusive climates embrace the unique qualities of all the members from various social groups (Gonzalez & DeNisi, 2009;Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998) and create an environment where individual employee feels comfortable to express their uniqueness and still be treated as an insider (Shore et al., 2011). Inclusive climate also requires the full and successful integration of a diverged group of people into a workplace or industry and a commitment to workplace diversity (Ball et al., 2005).\nAlthough diversity and inclusiveness are two different concepts, the nature and extent of diversity in the workplace essentially changes the dynamics of the inclusive management practices and usually makes it more complex. Moreover, diversity has an impact on the business performance. To create a diverse workplace, managers need to be more capable of dealing with diversity within their organisation and also externally in the community which requires inclusive management capabilities.\nEnhancing diversity is identified as one of the key factors that may help improve firms' performance. The minority friendly firms achieve significantly more return than the other firms according to extant literature. In their study, Bergen et al. (2005) focused on racial diversity more than the other kinds of diversity such as age, gender, and nationality. This study tried to find out the relationship between various forms of diversity and organisational performance. They found out that the companies are now creating racial, ethnic, and workforce balance not for the legal or ethical compliance but for the economic self-interest. Organisations need to hire people with necessary cultural and language skills to deal with local customers and finally earn more profit. Equal opportunities and fair treatment are found to be more important than demographic changes in contemporary business environment (Bergen et al., 2005).\nMost of the organisations focus on traditional workforce diversity issues like designing a new product team, dealing with multilingual workforce, comparing human resource practices in different countries, differences in accounting systems, security issues for global diversity, and so on. But the real situation is much more complex. The workforce across the world is more international. The new issues of diversity are outsourcing, migration, international legal constraints, and refugees. Diversity scholars have focused on diversity management initiatives or inclusive management practices to facilitate assimilation.\nDiversified workforce is necessary for the organisation as it is related to longterm success of the organisation. It also creates the competitive advantages for the organisation. Employees and managers of the organisation need to learn and understand the workforce diversity so that they can get the advantages from it (Aghazadeh, 2004). Turnover intention may also be influenced by the diversity. Groeneveld (2011) found that diversity policies are used to measure the effects of diversity management on the turnover intention. This study could not find out the reasons behind turnover or retention of employees in the Dutch public sector firms though the study emphasised on the diversity policies to realise the full potential of the diverse workforce.\nThe inclusive management practices or diversity policies are usually not legally binding on private sector. However, a legal framework for managing diversity in federal agencies exists in most of the Western economies that are open to migration (Syed & Kramar, 2010). Despite existence of such legal frameworks, Australian model for diversity management does not manage minor ethnic workers properly. Syed and Kramar (2009) focused on the incapability of government and business for integrating multilevel perspective of managing workforce. In Australia, organisations face a limited number of obligations for managing workforce diversity. Organisations also face difficulty with ensuring equality in employment. In the private sector, diversity management represents a voluntary corporate strategy, which is considered to be closely linked, to increased productivity and performance (Bertone & Leahy, 2001;Coleman, 1995). According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Network of Australia survey (EEONA, 2005), diversity programs currently give higher priority to issues associated with harassment (91%), women (75%), caring responsibilities (69%), and disability (59%) than to issues such as religion (22%) and nationality (25%). Even in best practicing organisations, diversity management has a narrow focus, for example, prioritising women, harassment, caring responsibilities, and disability ahead of religion, nationality, and race. The survey suggests that the major barriers to implementation include a lack of recognition of the business benefits of diversity, a lack of accountability and commitment by senior managers, a general lack of awareness of diversity issues, and a lack of resources and effective tools for implementation. Shen et al. (2009) found that there is a wide discrimination in employment. Women and members of minority groups get lesser chance of employment in higher organisational levels. These people are always disadvantaged in training, performance appraisal, and remuneration. Organisations recruit people from minority groups for lower positions and provide training of norms and values of the dominant organisational culture. There are some other problems like lack of pay parity. Employees from minority subculture cannot express their opinion. This study found that most of the companies do not have effective diversity management for implementing equal employment opportunity (EEO) and affirmative action (AA) to get advantages from diverse workforce.\nMoreover, ineffective diversity management also creates some problems like conflict, demotivation, higher employee turnover, and lower organisational performance. Muslim diaspora could be found especially challenging in the Western work context. A contextual approach to diversity considers the internal heterogeneity of Muslim diaspora and their traditions and sensitivities. A recent study found that Muslim diasporas in the United States face a problem with their own identification and also to integrate into global workforce and hence the recent issues on workforce diversity need to be considered (Mir, 2013).\nHuman resource department plays an important role in creating an inclusive organisational climate through its policies and practices. Welbourne et al. (2017) suggested facilitating employee resource groups (ERG) to create spaces where employees can be around others who share similar social groups/characteristics. Jansen et al. (2015) argued that \"multicultural\" practices tend to be more effective in making minority group members feel included whereas the so-called \"colourblind\" practices usually favour the majority or dominant culture in the work community. Shen et al. (2009) contended that through human resource management policies and practices, organisations can focus on EEO and AA, value diversity and utilise the knowledge and skills of a diverse workforce. In addition to this, flexible work arrangement (FWA) is a mean to enhance the organisational diversity and create inclusive work climate. Elisabeth et al. (2013) found the barriers to diversity enhancement through FWA. Organisational values regarding business pressure, client's obligatory, and long working hours create constraint in implementing the FWA and finally limit the diversity management practices.\n\nImportance of the Global Muslim Market\nThe global Muslim market provides huge opportunities for the West and also for the Muslim countries. One of the important demographic factors is that those Muslim consumers are largely young and emerging middle class (Hatia & Temporal, 2012) that accounts for considerable consumption by Muslim market segment. Many multinational companies are already attracted to the Muslim market such as Nestle. Many of Nestle brands are offering halal (religiously permitted) products. In 2008, Nestle achieved US$5.2 billion revenue only from halal products (Hatia & Temporal, 2012). There are some food chains like Nandos, Burger King, and Subway that are offering halal products in the outlets. Moreover, the demand for halal food in Europe is US$67 billion in 2010. The global halal market is valued at around US$2.3 trillion and worldwide halal food market is US$650 billion, and that is 17% of the global food industry (Hatia & Temporal, 2012).\nMuslim consumer market is the new niche for the United States companies. American Muslims want to get more acknowledgements in the marketplace. Nestle has about 20 factories in Europe with halal products. In the United States, McDonald's is already popular for its halal menu (Zoll, 2010). McDonald's has three times more customers in the Arab world. Microsoft has created an Egyptian outsourcing business which employed 65,000 people and generates more revenue. Another company, Best Buy Inc., is participating in a national advertisement through acknowledging a Muslim holiday-like Eid-ul-Azha or the fast of the sacrifice (Zoll, 2010). The concept of halal represents the daily application of Islamic law that is applied to food, drink, apparel hygiene products, nutritional supplements, and financial instruments. It is also applied to the business ethics, management styles, human resource policies, and manufacturing and production methods (Hatia & Temporal, 2012).\nMultinational companies based in the United States often balance some competing interests while doing business in Muslim countries. They need to comply with the local law and try to balance between local customs and company's culture. American companies need to accommodate Muslim religious practices at work in Muslim countries. For example, in case of religious holidays, they should make some arrangements that do not affect the entire workplace. On the other hand, career opportunity for women is limited in the Muslim world. Many women can play an important role as an expatriate in the business world. In Saudi Arabia, women should wear dress like over garment in the public place and sometimes on the job. It is one of the cultural norms in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, multinational companies need to consider these issues. On the other hand, in Yemen women are seen in business and they are considered more committed to their work than the male employees (Bloomberg Finance LP, 2010).\nIn the Muslim world, the United States companies need to consider other factors such as cash reserves, tax structure, and market size (Mutsikiwa & Basera, 2012). Otherwise, the United States companies will be confronted with cultural misunderstanding. Cultural aspects represent the real challenges for the companies. Some factors need to be considered like power, community, rules, communication, and Islamic finance for achieving these challenges. A study (Mutsikiwa & Basera, 2012) on consumers' perception tried to find out whether consumers' perception of halal food products is influenced by the sociocultural factors or not. These sociocultural factors are education, religion, occupation, and social stratification. The study found that education and wealth of individuals do not significantly influence the consumption of halal food, whereas religion has significant impact on the consumption of halal food and therefore a clear insight into the Muslim market is vital for the international businesses.\n\nResearch Gap\nDespite the importance of religion-based marketing and widely accepted significance of Muslim market in business literature, a research gap prevails in exploring the strategic advantages offered by the presence of Muslim diaspora in the Western workforce. Western literature on Muslim diaspora has predominantly focused on the social aspects or challenges of Muslim presence in Western workforce. Only a few research papers have remotely touched base with the unique aspects and advantage of including Muslim staff members in a Western organisation. Therefore, a significant research gap is visible in understanding the uniqueness of Muslim diaspora in the Western advance economy to plan an effective set of inclusive management practices to avail the full benefits of such programs.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN\nThis exploratory qualitative study uses the findings from 30 interviews with purposively selected Muslim migrant employees from the South Asian origin currently employed in Western advanced economies such as Australia, New Zealand, United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The key criteria for purposive selection required the respondents to: (1) hold a Muslim identity (the respondents must formally identify themselves as believers of Islamic faith to ensure that Muslim identity is reasonably central to their value system), (2) be working in an Englishspeaking Western country (for convenience of interpretation), (3) be working in a Western industry for at least five years to develop an understanding of inclusive practices, and (4) be working in a Western industry that is not predominantly employing Muslim workers for obvious strategic advantage (e.g., halal industry). This criterion was used to better observe and understand the perception of Muslim diaspora about inclusiveness practices in a diverged Western work community.\nThe respondents were initially recruited through the researchers' social network and then extended through snowballing.\nData has been collected via Skype and telephone interview using semi-structured interview schedule until the saturation point is reached (when no new information was emerging from the interviews). The responses have been transcribed and verified through email communication. The composition of the sample and the reasons behind their (or their ancestor's) migration is summarised in Table 1. Recursive abstraction and thematic approach have been used to analyse the qualitative data.\n\nThe Sample Composition and Relevant Personal Information of the Respondents\nOut of the 30 respondents, majority lives in Australia, United States, and United Kingdom. More than two-third of the respondents are male. The respondents are predominantly first-generation immigrants that travelled to the host country as a student and for a better life or as a spouse. More than two-third of the migrants are working in their core area of expertise in different sectors such as higher education, financial sector, customer services, IT sector, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and mining industry. About one-third of the respondents are working away from their core area of expertise. This information is detailed in Table 2 along with their reference identification (ID) or labels. These IDs have been used in the discussion against their respective statements.\n\nNature of Inclusive Management Practices Experienced by the Muslim Employees\nTen out of thirty respondents experienced discriminations in their Western workplace due to the religious identity as opposed to 12 that experienced no discrimination. The rest of the participants were not sure if they have faced discrimination. Some of the noteworthy comments (presented below) will help describe the nature and extent of both positive and negative discrimination faced by the members of Muslim diaspora in the Western organisations. These comments will also help identify the preferred treatments in the workplace that Muslim employees consider to be inclusive management practices that may lead to positive employee outcomes.\nEveryone treats me the same way they treat others, but they make sure that I am aware of any food that contains pork (R-2).\nIt becomes very hard to find time and space to pray during office hours.\nAs Muslims are non-alcoholic, so it creates some dilemmas in official parties. Whether to attend or not, what to eat-some haram food like pork is also available, what to wear in office especially for women, whether to celebrate non-Islamic events like Halloween, Black Friday, and others (R-17).\nSome identified respectful interest in Islamic customs to be indicative of inclusive climate. For example, R-14 stated, \"I sometimes get asked about religion and like talking about my religion to the people who seemed interested in knowing about Islam.\" An interesting view has been offered by R-19: \"There are discriminations in the workplace due to religious identity, but I have not faced this in the workplace. Actually, it depends on how skilled a person is. A highly skilled person faces little or no discrimination. Some companies are very strict on any kind of employee discrimination.\" He implied that the presence, nature, and intensity of perceived and/or actual discrimination depends largely on the skills and abilities of the Muslim worker as well as the strictness or leniency of the company policy against discriminations.\nOne of the respondents from higher education sector appreciated his university's inclusive climate. He stated: In my workplace it is the rule to respect everyone irrespective of gender, culture, religion, or language differences. Hence, the attitude towards international student is very positive. The university has arranged separate prayer rooms and associate facilities for Muslims and for other religions as well. Cafeterias have halal options (R-22).\nAbout eight participants stated that they have faced some issues in their workplace. However, they are not sure if they should brand it as Islamophobia or religious discrimination or lack of inclusiveness. For example, R-9 stated, \"To get promotion in the company where I am working it took eight years. I wonder why after having very good recommendations from colleagues, there is a delay in case of promotion.\" When the respondents were asked if they are expected to behave in a certain way due to their cultural or religious identity (stereotypes), 22 out of 30 respondents said they did not feel such vibe in their climate. They stated that others usually understand if the Muslim workers want to take leave to celebrate religious festivals. The others could not particularly specify any stereotype about Muslim community in the workplace although they sense a negative vibe in the climate. A few said Islamophobia or stereotype against Muslim community is a worldwide phenomenon rather than an organisational issue. Respondents R-8 and R-19 sensed this general negativity against members from Muslim diaspora in their respective workplaces. R-19 stated, \"It exists in all Western countries. They have created this phobia to dominate other countries.\" When the respondents were asked if they faced social isolation due to their cultural identity from their work team, 23 out of 30 claimed not to have experienced any such social isolation. R-2 said, \"We go for different activities like bowling or to a pub for team building and they do not mind if I don't drink.\" R-8 said, \"If I go to after hour hangout, I don't drink alcohol, that's ok with my colleagues.\" Some other statements in line with this thought are as follows: I often get asked to meet after work to hang out together with my coworkers and I joined my co-workers in after work activities sometimes. I never felt that I was being left out because of my cultural or religious background (R-14). This last statement implies that discriminative or non-inclusive practices in workplace may be reciprocal to the behaviour and attitude of the recipient of discrimination. The lack of openness of a Muslim employee towards the dominant culture in the work community may elicit exclusion and eventually contribute to creating a non-inclusive work climate and vice versa.\n\nImpact of Inclusive Management Practices on the Behaviour of the Muslim Workers\nA total of 17 out of 30 respondents said that they do not necessarily feel more comfortable being a part of any specific subculture, i.e., Muslim diasporic community in workplace or their home country community. These 17 respondents belong to the segment of respondents who do not feel any stereotypes or negative discriminations in the work community due to their religious identity. They are also the ones who predominantly believes that discrimination is reciprocal, i.e., the attitude and behaviour of the target of discrimination may stimulate non-inclusive climate. One of these respondents stated, \"My workplace is multicultural and there are people of various backgrounds and as long as a person is friendly, I feel comfortable\" (R-2).\nTherefore, it is safe to propose that the perceived inclusive climate may be reciprocated by positive attitude and behaviour among the members of Muslim diaspora in workplace. By the same token, the Muslim employees' positive attitude towards the dominant culture may reinforce non-discriminatory practices and shape a strong inclusive organisational culture.\nOnly 2 out of 30 respondents said they feel more comfortable within a certain subculture in the workplace. For example, R-8 said, \"Yes, I am more comfortable with my sub-continental colleagues, such as Indian, Bangladeshi, Srilankan, and Pakistani.\" Respondent R-11 stated: I'm connected with Muslim Community Association in California. I can do my regular prayer there. They provide every facility a Muslim can have, like woman's education, child education, gym for men and women, halal food and free iftar (breakfast during religious fasting month) for all. They also provide scholarship to students.\nAlthough R-11 was referring to a community in a social context outside the workplace, she would feel more comfortable in a similar community in her workplace which supports Welbourne et al.'s (2017) case for designing employee resource groups for the subcultures in the organisations.\nThe others felt like there is no other subculture formed in their workplace to belong to. They see the workplace as a professional community and there is no question of feeling comfortable with someone based on religious identity. R-13 said, \"My relationship with my co-workers is strictly professional, and I don't feel that my cultural or religious background would have any influence on my job performance.\" Another participant claimed, \"I often get inquisitive inquiries from different people about my cultural or religious background. I like letting people know about my birthplace or my religion and educate people about Islam\" (R-14). R-16 said there is no strong subculture in his workplace. Respondent R-22 believes, \"the comfortable level depends on a person's behaviour. It is not related to cultural perspective.\" This group of respondents also predominantly perceives their work climate as inclusive and seem to have reciprocated that climate in their attitude and behaviour.\n\nMuslim Employees' Perspective on the Strategic Advantage of Inclusive Climate in the Western Workplace\nThe respondents stated some positive strategic outcomes of inclusive climate experienced in their organisations in terms of (1) enhanced cultural intelligence and competitive advantage from diversity and inclusiveness in the work community, (2) ethical and legal compliance, (3) improved service quality, and (4) future expansion of business and market.\nMost respondents believe that diversified workforce can generate more innovative ideas and Muslim diaspora help ensure the diversity in the workforce. One of the respondents said: It is a competitive advantage for an organisation. If it is more diversified, then it can incorporate many ideas or talents. I feel that, in some aspect, businesses in Bangladesh now have more network in Western immigrant-based countries as many Muslim Bangladeshis are living in those states. So, they can reach many Western organisations through their countryman if they want (R-17).\nAnother respondent said, \"My inclusion from Bangladeshi background may have increased diversity within the academic staff members\" (R-3).\nDiversified employees are one of the important sources of competitive advantages. Respondent R-17 stated, \"Immigrant population is the driving force in Canada's economy. An organisation should be diversified into cultural/religious identity or country of origin. Because of diversified employees is the competitive advantage for an organisation through incorporating many ideas/talents.\" An organisation can demonstrate superior ethical practices by including members from minority subcultures. This practice is viewed by a few respondents as a legal or moral obligation. One of the respondents stated, \"I feel they may have a moral obligation to have a certain number of employees of different backgrounds\" (R-2).\nAnother respondent viewed the inclusion of Muslim members in workforce as a positive step towards upgrading the ethical standards in the work community. He said: I think a Muslim person holds strong ethics at work which can help the workforce. It will also build trust in Western community that all Muslim people are not conservative or extremist. It will help to keep peace and make a bond between the non-Muslims and Muslims (R-21).\n\nAnother respondent said:\nI feel that if the organisation is connected with Western workforce, they can encourage anti-racism practice. That means a company should be free from any religious restriction, and it should not distinguish employee based on their race, sex, or other non-work-related criteria. An individual can practice Islam while working with any Western workforce. People of our (Bangladeshi) country of origin will attract more people with this philosophy (R-11).\n\nAnother respondent stated:\nMy belief is that those from culturally different backgrounds can be used together to show that religious or cultural differences can be put aside and living or working peacefully together can be possible while letting those of different faiths to practice whatever they like in their private times (R-10).\nAll these statements indicate the benefits of increasing diversity in workplace from a moral or legal point of view which benefits the organisation by ensuring sustainable development. Moreover, different cultural backgrounds can foster better communication in case of customer services. A respondent said: Australia is a multicultural country. People come from more than 200 countries. My cultural background helps my company to look after its clients. In the same way, Muslim countries get lots of information regarding foreign culture, economy, and politics from the people living overseas and can plan its business expansion to foreign markets (R-19).\nThis was an example of how the cultural orientation and understanding of a predominantly Muslim country can help improve the current and future performance of the Western organisation and create future scope for international businesses.\nSimilarly, R-23 stated: It has been said that a company or organisation can be benefitted from a person for his/her independent sharing of knowledge and contributing experience, although he/she is from different culture/religious background/identity. My organisation has the opportunity to utilise the benefits of my presence and skills to enrich or compete with the other companies for expanding business/market.\nAnother respondent said, \"I am leading the antibacterial drug discovery initiative at my university. My understanding of Muslim culture adds value to the development and future commercialisation of the drug\" (R-3). These are all essentially reflections on how Muslim cultural orientations may better serve the Western organisations to expand market in predominantly Muslim countries by considering the Islamic values to better sell their product and also by creating new relationships and network based on mutual respect and understanding.\nMoreover, \"Muslim diasporas help to increase diversification and inclusion at workplace, grow deeper understanding of Muslim culture, and apply the knowledge to expand business globally\" (R-7). Some other similar responses are presented below: No direct advantage, but indirectly when I speak to Indian or Bangladeshi Muslim customer, I try to build a rapport based on our cultural identity, it does work sometimes (R-8).\nDuring a specified time period, my university arranges a voice survey for ensuring cross cultural, open communication, accountability, and respect. Being a part of this one will help the organisation in workforce planning and development (R-22).\nRespondent R-7 sums it up by stating: In a country like Canada where the immigrant populations are the driving force of economy, an organisation should be diverse in employee cultural/religious identity/country of origin. It's a competitive advantage for an organisation if it's more diversified that's how it can incorporate many ideas/talents from across the globe.\nMuslim community may pave the future business and market expansion opportunities for the businesses in Muslim countries as well for mutual benefits. R-6 stated: I know that lots of businessmen and business minded people migrated to Canada. Since they are living in Canada, they certainly have easy access and clear idea on local Canadian business market. I feel that Bangladesh can take advantage to expand their business in Canada by using these people.\nSuch interaction can help develop a global network that holds immeasurable future opportunities for international business and supply chain management.\nTwelve out of thirty employees stated that their organisation can use their presence as an opportunity to expand business/market or as a core competence. The following comments best reflect their answers: Sometimes when I speak with a Muslim customer, mainly from the Middle East, they feel happier and more comfortable speaking with me, so in that aspect I would say they can relate to the organisation (R-2).\nYes. Predominantly I am working in an area rich in Asian and Muslim people. This of course gives an added advantage to me and to my organisation due to the understanding of their religious boundaries and special requirements (R-5).\nI can utilise my knowledge of the behavioural patterns of my ethnicity (the respondent was referring to Muslim background) to tailor customised products. They definitely use my (Muslim) background to explore more commercial work (R-9).\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nIn line with the business and organisational diversity and inclusiveness literature (Butts et al., 2009;Hatia & Temporal, 2012), our evidence suggests that multifaceted strategic advantages are offered by the inclusion of Muslim diaspora in the Western organisations. These include the successful incorporation of the appropriate facilities or options to attract and satisfactorily serve the growing Muslim clients, enhancement of cultural intelligence and cohesion within the diverse workforce, and possibility of expansion of business to the Muslim countries.\nOur results also offer a better insight into the effective inclusive management practices for Muslim members of an organisation that are increasingly perceived as complex and challenging in the Western advanced economy. For example, our respondents mentioned that (1) confusing and limited food choices (halal options) in the office parties for the Muslim workers, (2) conflicting schedule with their prayer times, (3) official dress code contrary to Islamic modesty requirements (especially in case of female respondents), and (4) subtle reflection of deep routed cultural stereotypes and stigma against Muslim community transmitted from the broader society may at times reflect negatively on an otherwise inclusive workplace. Some respondents emphasised on the invisible exclusion of Muslim workers evidenced by slow promotions or higher inclusion in technical positions as opposed to the leadership or strategic decision-making roles. Many of these issues can be resolved by adapting the inclusive human resource management practices and policies as suggested by Shen et al. (2009), i.e., focusing on EEO and AA, value diversity, by utilising the knowledge and skills of a diverse workforce and FWA as recommended by Elisabeth et al. (2013) to increase diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace.\nIn line with social exchange theory, some respondents viewed inclusive climate as an outcome of reciprocal inclusive interaction between the organisation and Muslim employees. They emphasised on an increased and effective communication and social exchange across subcultures and with the dominant culture in the organisation. Contrary to the popular believe, our respondents expressed their willingness to share and explain their religious values and practices to their colleague for a better understanding of each other. They also feel more welcome and included in a team if their colleagues or manager show interest in understanding their religious values and rituals which in turn has positive effects on their level of commitment, engagement, and sense of empowerment in the work community.\nThis finding is particularly interesting because it also extends the scope of social exchange theory beyond the popular exchange or reciprocity between organisation and employees. The extant diversity, equity, and inclusiveness literature predominantly focus on a one directional perspective of inclusive climate where organisation create provisions and system for inclusiveness and employees reciprocate through loyalty and performance. Our findings reveal the significance of a bidirectional exchange between employees from different religious or cultural background that has rarely been explored in diversity and inclusiveness studies. Our respondents reported a more enhanced feeling of inclusion when their co-workers took interest in discussing their faith, religious practices, and cultural values rather than carefully avoiding such interaction to manage discrimination. The managers may be trained to initiate such respectful conversations and interactions to create a more inclusive climate.\nOur findings do not negate the validity or advantage of designing employee resource groups as suggested by Welbourne et al. (2017). We rather suggest an additional inclusiveness strategy for a Western organisation where such homogenous subculture resource groups cannot be formed due to some structural or systemic constraints such as limited number of representatives from a certain homogenous group in proximate location or work group. We argue for designing appropriate provisions for the subculture resource groups while making sure that it remains optional to the employees from a subculture to avail such opportunities. Such options must not be an imposition on employees from a subculture even when they prefer not to avail such opportunity. A regular survey among the minority subcultures may indicate the preferred course of inclusiveness in an organisation. In some cases, a Muslim employee may seek a subculture resource group and space in a broader community setting rather than within the work community or organisation.\nOur findings also support the use of the \"multicultural\" (i.e., colourful) approach to inclusiveness as suggested by Jansen et al. (2016) as opposed to using the socalled colour-blind approach that predominantly favours the dominant culture in the workforce. However, multiculturalism should not be designed to exclude the other subcultures or dominant culture of the work community in this process because such climate is not likely to enhance the feeling of inclusiveness amongst the members of the Muslim diaspora in the Western organisations.\nDue to considerable existing stereotypes against Muslim community in the Western culture, it seems important to address the rarely explored issue of how to create an inclusive climate to effectively avail the full benefits from including Muslim members in the Western workforce. Social exchange theory focuses on the interactive relationships between employees and the organisation which is strengthened by employee trust. Trust is built on the perceived benefits from reward, respect, justice, and resources offered by the organisation that are essentially the key components of inclusive practices. Respondents emphasised on the invisible indicators of non-inclusive climates such as slow promotion, less representation of Muslim employees in leadership positions, limited choices of Muslim meals in office parties, conflicting schedule with prayer times to have an impact on their job satisfaction, trust, and commitment to the organisation. Some viewed open interaction about religious values and celebration of all religious festivals as inclusive management practices that leads to higher job satisfaction and performance. Others viewed inclusive climate as the outcome of reciprocal attitude and social exchange between Muslim and non-Muslim subculture within the organisation. Managers should be trained to better facilitate such exchange and organisations should look for ways to remove apparently invisible obstacles to ensure deserving promotion of members from the minority subcultures. This novel perspective of utilising cultural knowledge and presence of Muslim diaspora as one of the strategic advantages of a Western organisation may especially help managers of multinational organisations to conceptualise new ways of internationalisation that are mutually beneficial to both home and host countries.\nMore number of respondents from different countries of origin would further enrich the study. The future researchers may conduct quantitative research among the members of Muslim diaspora in the Western workforce that will confirm a statistically significant positive link between inclusive management practices and attitude and behaviour of employees from different Muslim cultural origin. Future researchers may also compare the variation of such relationship across Muslim diaspora from different origins moderated by relevant characteristics such as gender, age, language skills, and generation of migrants."

              "Peaceful Fiqh; Jürgen Habermas’s Hermeneutical Studies in the Verses of Jihad\n\nThe most crucial problem in analyzing problematic violence in Islam is when relating it with text religion. Problematic violence will appear more paradoxical and crucial when trying to legitimize al-Qur'an. When violence and terrorism get legitimacy from al-Qur'an, it will lead to a very risky conclusion; namely, Islam supports violence and terrorism. This is where the hermeneutics of Jurgen Habermas tries to review the problem of interpretation of these verses, especially concerning the theory of communication actions which will be used as an analytical knife in this study. The problem formulation is; how to read verse jihad without using instrumental interpretation and more developed paradigm communicative hermeneutics. The result of this research is that Jurgen Habermas's view will presuppose the formation of an intersubjective relationship in social society. The act of communication aims to reach an understanding between individuals. In relation to religious tolerance, the expected communication is a dialogue in reaching agreement on claims of accuracy in the underlying values of each religion on how to build agreement on each religion and that peace is beautiful and violence is terrible. This claim necessitates an interactive dialogue that explores holistic religious values but avoids discussing truth claims considered non-negotiable religious doctrines. When it is applied in the interpretation of the jihad verse, the conclusion that we hope for is the jihad verse cannot abolish the universal value contained in the peace verse.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIt is common knowledge that humans and religion cannot be separated (Muhajarah & Bariklana, 2021;. The importance of religion is increasingly needed; interest in religion increased in the 20th century, especially in relation to matters of meaning, the purpose of life, ethics, morals, and values (Jalaluddin, 2021: 20). Humans agree that one of the basic human intuitive instincts in religion is spiritual, a clear and deep feeling, does not look at the material and can move positive relationships in society. Mutual respect, respect between fellow human beings, and giving help are values instilled in every religion (Muhajarah, 2016). All religious teachings have the same goal: peace and non-violence, mutual help, and forgiveness because all religions on this earth teach the goodness and peace of human Vol. 3 No. 2 December (2022) life .\nTherefore, the problem of violence and terrorism is not something relevant if it is associated with Islam (Muhajarah, 2016a;Muhajarah, 2018). Because of their meaning alone, it has been shown that both are contradictory. Islam means peace and safety, so that will be contradictory if Islam and violence are juxtaposed simultaneously. Even paradox that's what appears when discussing problem this.\nThis does not mean that Islam substantially contains violent values. Still, the problem of violence and terrorism appears incidentally when interacting with religious texts, especially with regard to verses in the Qur'an that indicate violence in Islam (Muhajarah, 2019). Verses become more problematic when interpreted without seeing the situation and condition. So the formation ideology of violence and terrorism starts from interpreting its religious verse .\nThe most crucial problem in analyzing problematic violence in Islam is when relating it to text religion, and those are in the Qur'an and the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad. Problematic violence will appear more paradoxical and crucial when base ideological on problematic than trying legitimized al-Qur'an. When violence and terrorism get legitimacy from religious texts, it will lead to a very risky conclusion; namely, Islam supports violence and terrorism. That conclusion possibility big could be achieved when the interpretation of verse al-Qur'an is conducted by arbitrarily and textual and does not heed the situation and condition incident historically from a determination of law. From the interpretation here, ideology violence is built with quibble that al-Qur'an alone gives legitimacy and command to action violence and terrorism. The irony again, with existence interpretation unilateral, will give birth to stereotyping towards Islam as a blocker of tolerance and kingpin of world terrorism. This is where the hermeneutics of Jurgen Habermas tries to review the problem of interpretation of these verses, especially about the theory of communication actions which will be used as an analytical knife in this study. So there are some anxiety or problem formulations that are the subject of the study as well as being a limiter of the study. Among the formulation of the problem are; how to read verse jihad without instrumental interpretation and more developed paradigm hermeneutics communicative. A constructed interpretation from braid more relationship humane, deep relation that expected will bear from a desire for attitude each other respect, protect and care for each other understand.\n\nJürgen Habermas's Hermeneutical Studies\nHabermas' hermeneutics is dialectical hermeneutics, in which the subject (hermeneut/interpreter) and object (which is interpreted) have the right to present themselves openly. There is no domination because there is dynamic-constructive criticism. This critical-communicative discourse can be a valuable lesson in developing Islamic studies, especially in interpreting the Qur'an.\nAs supported by Harun Nasution in realizing a communicative Qur'an, humans are given the freedom to interpret the Qur'an, regardless of the Qur'an's superstitions, which are already considered holy and even anti-critic. The truth of the Qur'an is the truth according to human standards. The Qur'an cannot show its truth without including the human view of truth. So the truth of the Qur'an is a human truth (Muhajarah & Hayyuningtyas, 2022). It is only natural that humans are given space in interpret the Qur'an (Muhajarah, 2016b).\nHarun Nasution argues that the Qur'an is imperfect (in quotes). The reason is, first, the verses of the Qur'an that speak in the aspects of science, technology, and socialism, are not systematically and comprehensively -if not to say they do not exist. Second, there are benefits if the Qur'an is not perfect. Because that is where the divine message is implied, namely, dynamic human beings (Nasution, 2015: 21-28).\nBasically, Habermas' hermeneutics cannot be separated from the concept of understanding (verstehen) and explaining (eklarung) as proposed by Dilthey from the start. These two terms are very meaningful and important to him. Eklarung's focus is on being able to explain issues related to the natural sciences, while Verstehen's focus is on issues related to Geisteswissenschften (humanitarian sciences or social studies).\nHowever, Habermas maintains that earlier critical theory has failed to explain the broader conception of ratio. The solution proposed by Habermas is to change the emphasis of philosophy from subject-object relations to intersubjective communication in his book Knowledge and Human Interest, he states that the existence of society depends on two actions: work or instrumental action and social interaction or communicative action, these two forms of action form the principle of different human interests. This in turn will lead to the formation of a completely different kind of knowledge. Hermeneutics and critical assessment methods whose purpose is to understand the other party are born from communicative action. While the study of empirical analysis which aims to control the processes that occur objective knowledge is born from instrumental action (Nasir, 2004: 34).\nAccording to Habermas, the problem of communication is a fundamental problem that affects the construction of hermeneutic thinking considering that hermeneutics itself is always in the context of communication. Habermas emphasizes the existence of continuous communication and dialogue to create a common understanding or consensus about a matter (Sumaryono, 2019: 94). Habermas's thinking has come out of the traditional philosophical framework that focuses on \"consciousness\" towards \"language\" as a means of communication, as well as the basis for the theory of \"communicative action\" which is formulated (Supena, 2022: 135).\nThe theory of \"communicative action\" which has been conceptualized by Habermas influenced his view of the method of understanding in hermeneutics.\nAccording to Habermas, \"to understand\" means to understand the meaning according to tradition, so that a meaning will be found if the hermeneut understands the meaning of his time. Therefore, the task of hermeneutics is to communicate the two worlds of meaning and the results of their interpretation are needed to understand social behavior that is directed by the meanings that apply today (Sumaryono, 2019: 94).\nAccording to Habermas, \"communicative interaction\" is an autonomous space that allows a historical cultural tradition to be transmitted and social relations to be regulated institutionally. Through the idea of \"communicative interaction\", Habermas intends to make a paradigm shift in understanding the dimensions of praxis from the \"work\" paradigm to the \"communication\" paradigm. This is the difference between Habermas's thoughts and those of the previous characters. As before, Hegel distinguished the interpretation of work and language (interaction) in the context of his idealistic philosophy. Hegel interprets work and language in the context of the self-formation (Bildungprozess) of spirit or ratio to be absolute. However, by Karl Marx, the process of self-formation was placed in the historical context of an empirical society (Supena, 2022: 116). Although Marx still recognized the difference between work and communication, Marx put too much emphasis on work, while the field of interaction was not understood.\nIn Habermas' view, every action is teleological and purposeful. Because an actor will take actions that are expected to produce success and certain goals in the end (Schecter, 2010: 186). This social action also requires the interaction of two or more social action agents to achieve understanding and coordination. In realizing this coordination and understanding, Habermas divides two mechanisms of social action; (1) consent (consensus), (2) influence. Agreement requires an understanding between two agents in interpreting a condition. In this approval or licensing process, an intersubjective dialogue is built. Meanwhile, the influence process is through the mechanism of persuasion and is very vulnerable to domination and discrimination (Owen, 2012: 35-36).\nFundamentally, this theory of communicative action contains the idea of distinguishing between two concepts of rationality that compose a knowledge in order to direct an action (Fitri & Muhajarah, 2021). First, success-oriented cognitiveinstrumental rationality. And second, communicative rationality which emphasizes the goal to understand each other which is conceptualized as a process to reach agreement between subject conversations to harmonize interpretations (Pusey, 2021: 109).\nAccording to Habermas, in understanding the meaning of the \"interlocutor\", it takes an effort called validity claims. The claims (testimony/consensus) are divided into four types, namely: 1). Claims of Truth, namely agreements about the natural and objective world. Objective validity that \"What I say is true or in accordance with facts\". 2). Claims of Rightness, namely agreement about norms in the social world.\n\nClaim of Sincerety) the congruence between one's inner world and one's expressions\nIntersubjective validity that \"I am doing what is right for me in a given environment\".\n\n4)\nClaim of Comprehensibility, namely the ability to explain the various claims and reach agreement Comprehensive validity is agreement between various communicating subjects (Habermas, 2017: 37).\nIt can be emphasized, that \"understanding\" in Habermas' view requires dialogue, because the process of understanding is a process of \"cooperation\" in which Vol. 3 No. 2 December (2022) questions relate to each other simultaneously in the world of life (lebenswelt) which includes the objective world, the subjective world and the social world. The objective world is the totality of all truths that make true statements possible. The social world is the totality of all interpersonal or personal relationships that are considered legitimate and orderly. The subjective world is the totality of the experience of the object of speech or \"my own world\", \"my own experience\" (Kaelan, 1998: 98).\nDialogic theme in theory of communicative action can found in reflection hermeneutics, because when the interpreter makes analysis, he permanent is at at level action communicative with interact aspect language, action and experience. in between third aspect that language get prime place. However thus, for reach understanding with intermediary language required direction, that is sort of mechanism coordinated action, so that even though use consensus certain, the interpreter can coordinate herself going to certain direction destination (Sumaryono, 2019: 87-88).\n\nThe Verses of Jihad\nEtiquette deal with problem violence specifically jihad in al-Qur'an, there will be two sides to the problem. In one side al-Qur'an instruct for be patient and apply fair to group that opposite with Islam (Muhajarah & Mudhofi, 2021). On the other side, actually there is the verse that negate and command Muslims for fighting people who none in line with Islam . This is what becomes location problem in respond and interpret this verse. Before more far analyze this problematic then will be included a number of verses in al-Qur'an yang indicates existence order violence and terrorism in al-Qur'an or verse qital (Muhajarah, 2020). Next from this verse of jihad is what is made as tool legitimacy for fundamentalists for doing violence and terrorism, they are: When already finished those forbidden months, then kill the polytheists anywhere you see you them, catch them, take them, and spy on the place reconnaissance. If them repent and build pray and pay zakat, then give freedom to them for walking Indeed, God is great Forgiver again Maha Loving.\" (QS. at-Taubah, 9: 5) The verses above are known as 'saif verses' or sword verses and these verses are considered as a legitimate tool to carry out acts of violence against non-Muslims.\nMuslims and things to judge violate Islamic law.\nIt will be even more problematic when the verse is confronted with verses that command peace, namely: \"So forgive and let it go they, until God brings His command. Truly God is great power above everything something.\" (QS: al-Baqara, 2: 109) And if God had willed, they would not have been associated with them, and We would not have made you a guardian over them, and you would not be a guardian over them\" (QS: al-An'am, 6: 107).   (Zayd, 2018: 89). Those phenomena are representation from ideology and attitude Muslims against non-Muslims.\n\nAnalysis of the Interpretation of the Verses of Jihad\nIt seems that the verses of jihad will forever lead to violence and hinder the construction of peace between religious communities, as long as the interpretation is built from an attitude of hostility, condescension and suspicion towards adherents of other religions, and the same is true for other religions. Supposition of a new approach is necessary in interpret verse of jihad by specifically and religious texts general related with relation with followers of other religions (Streusand: 1997;Hasan: 2006). Approach is that me born? a more tolerant paradigm, inclusive, and open for difference opinion and more for difference belief. Approach this will give a street new in deal with text vulnerable religion to problem violence (Muhajarah, 2018b).\nThrough Habermas's theory of hermeneutics, especially with regard to communicative (dialectical) actions, it will provide a hope to change the paradigm that has been rampant among clergy. Theory action communicative, as discussed next, will give a paradigm in interaction between people diverse religions. This theory will give view new for the followers of other religions in see arrangement the reality that lasts this only divided two; evil and good.\nHabermas thought that would study in this paper is development of public communicative. So that the suppressor is how build a capable ratio rely on public communicative. A action capable realized in level reality when action the has go through the process interpretation to situation. From the process of analyzing and interpreting situation next will give birth to an action (Owen, 2012: 35). Even score from action the will very depends on the underlying ratio interpretation process, so that ratio that only prioritize success and success will very susceptible for To do domination and discrimination. Importance Habermas 's thinking lies at this point.\nWith start analyze ratio so score from the action will look. Action is reflection from paradigm base thinking someone, and paradigm the is built from interpretation to the situation that there is.\nOverview of the third form above interpretation could said as representation attitude each group in Islam when interact with non-Muslims. Complexity from problem this the more increase because received or whether or not third the opinion above, is also very influenced by policy political from development interpretation that Mu'tazilah for example, is one sect in discriminated Islam consequence existence discrimination intellectual from opponent debate them. One form from discrimination intellectual is naming sect that alone with The Mu'tazilites who simple could interpreted as the moving group go from crowd. Finally naming this manipulated as the group that move from truth (Nassyar, 2015: 376). So that phobia occurs and when follow or adhere to opinion them.\nRepresentation majority Muslims are in opinion first and second, however sadly Becomes a ideology in formation attitude interactive between religious people.\nExclusive interpretation in deal with difference and plurality. Muslims in second the opinion above is chosen people from God, in charge for fight and stop all shape and type kufr above this earth. Ideology this will very thick with dimensions less exclusivity value difference. With this exclusive ideology, differences are not seen as a result of cultural wealth, but differences are an anomaly that must be avoided, in order to realize an absolute unification in every aspect of life.\nHowever, the Mu'tazilites emphasized the universal value and holistic value of the message of the Qur'an. So that the Mu'tazilah are not in a hurry in establishing a certain law in the Qur'an, regardless of the situation and context in which the law applies. In other words, in determination law a order in the Koran, no necessarily applied without through analysis logical to relevance law the with situation, conditions and context from that law. With existence contextualization to every order in the Qur'an, then relevance Al-Qur'an will the more seen with clear. This no means that application law in the Qur'an could conducted with arbitrarily and at will heart. However, contextualization the must pass qualification certain one among them, that determination law the must conducted based on observation on reality that has happen. In addition, the contextuality of certain verses in the Qur'an must be based on and sourced from historical events that occurred at the time of the Prophet, or at least the implications of certain events. In short, a command in the verse of the Qur'an must have: potency for contextualized or relevant with situation and conditions certain (Muhsin, 1996: 15-16).\nThere is a potential contextuality to the law in the jihad verses above. This is reinforced by the opinion of the Mu'tazilah that the particular message cannot erase the law contained in the universal message. This means that the message contained in the jihad verse is particular and cannot erase the universal message contained in the peace verse. Because, God wills for the plenary goodness on this earth, and one of the forms of the plenary goodness is the creation of peace between human beings. Thus the message of peace is a universal message that cannot be abolished or legalized by a particular and temporal jihad order.\nIn Habermas' theory, the real function of instrumental rationality is to determine the appropriate means to achieve certain goals. Thus, means only remain means and never serve as ends. But at a crisis level, the means turn into goals and even goals are forgotten due to the importance of achieving success. If this concept is applied in reading the verses of jihad, then on a normal level, jihad is only a means of self-defense in order to achieve the goals of peace and social stability (Bayne, 2015). Meanwhile, at the extreme level, jihad is no longer a means, but has turned into a goal.\nThe jihad was once only a suggestion instrument in achieving the goals of the peace process between Muslims and non-Muslims. Instead, his position changed to a goal, jihad turned into a goal to dichotomize right and wrong, disbelievers and believers, lucky and losers and winners and losers. In fact, peace, which is a fundamental value in every religion, cannot be placed in the right position (Muhajarah & Fabriar, 2021).\nBeside that, goal from religion in the form of peace and justice equally for people human, embodied with means certain. Now destination the already no capable seen again in social reality. In fact, there is a reversal, the instruments that were previously used to achieve the goals of religion, have now become the center of religious goals (Muhajarah, 2019). Religious doctrines and teachings are actually intended to support rationalization means in reach purpose. That is, religious doctrine is intended to legitimize violence by using religious texts, either in the form of one-sided interpretations or worse, manipulation of the text with a specific purpose.\nFrom the interpretation of the jihad verse that has been described previously, it can be seen that the opinion that says the jihad verse cancels the legal content of the peaceful verse has been infected by the instrumental paradigm. This opinion no longer heeds the purpose of religion itself, namely peace and justice that is equitable for mankind. The value contained in the verse of peace no longer has meaning, because verse the no capable offer success or even superiority in monopolize truth.\nWith make verse jihad as shield, then seen group this attempted to do dogmatization Be found explanatory verses about the character of Islam as a preaching religion that states that no there is coercion in religion. Nope there is one even a verse in the Qur'an that says that war that intended for force people to converted to Islam. That's one of them conclusion from research Sheikh Mahmud Syaltut, inside His book is al-Qur'an wa al-Qital. Sheikh Syaltut also explained that purpose war is for stop tyranny and persecution, for create peace and religious tranquility.\n\nConclusion\nThrough Jurgen Habermas's view, it would presuppose the formation of a relationship intersubjective in the social public. Action communication aims to reach an understanding between individuals. Relation with religious tolerance, expected communication is an inner dialogue reach deals with claim accuracy in the underlying value of each religion. It means building a deal with every religion, that peace that is beautiful and that bad violent. Claim this necessary for an interactive dialogue that explores values holistic religious, but avoid discussing claim considered truth as certain religious doctrines that do not could negotiable again. When that is applied in the interpretation of verse war, then our conclusion is hope is the universal value contained in verse peace no could remove with verse war, even verse fight actually that must is temporal."

              "EFFORTS TO ERODE DICHOTOMIES USING INTEGRATIVE LEARNING MODELS IN ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS EDUCATION\n\nScience and religion have always been regarded as two conflicting and even conflicting regions. The post-new order situation gave birth to freedom of voice, thought and work which greatly influenced a person's morale towards views on the world of education. Public Public Primary School education seems to have failed to produce civilized human beings according to Islam. Islamic-based education, which was originally not in great demand, reinvented space in the eyes of the community. Both of these regions are actively involved in efforts to answer human origins and goals. Religion draws its answers from revelation and intuition, whereas science bases its beliefs on ratios and scientific reasoning. As for the efforts of science and religion to coexist, it is nothing more than an attitude of mutual respect for each region but a collaboration between the two sciences in order to erode the dichotomy in the field of education and be able to answer the times. The purpose of this writing is to attempt to erode the dichotomy of education with integrative models. The discussion shows that there are four kinds of conflicts between religion and science, namely conflict, independence, dialogue, and integration.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe era of globalization today, has a positive and negative impact on the development of adolescents, One of the phenomena that is now developing is the depletion of morale. This is the case in all walks of life. Many people have already ignored his attitude and behavior. The era of globalization brought about a major change to the world order as a whole and that change was faced together as a natural change (Ningsih, 2015). Because, inevitably, ready to be unprepared for the change to happen. Increasingly rapid global changes are occurring, marked by advances in information and communication technology. This advancement in science and technology has encouraged the pace of the globalization process. Such a reality will affect the values, attitudes or behaviors of today's teenagers (Hidayat, 2016).\nThe main purpose of moral and religious education is to prepare students to be able to live well in their society, be able to develop and improve their own quality of life and make a meaningful contribution in developing and improving the quality of life of the community and the nation. Education is a preventive measure, because the education carried out today will be applied in the future. So education at this time must be able to answer problems and be able to solve the problems faced. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration if until now education is still as something main in the community of a society. The perception of society will become logical if it is really observed that education will give humans the opportunity to have knowledge, various skills and other skills (Taher, 2014).\nTo develop Islamic Religious Education in realizing religious culture and values, it is not enough just to develop classroom learning in the form of improving the quality and increasing learning hours, but how to make PAI a school culture. A strategic form of PAI development by improving the leadership roles of schools with all their power to cultivate through habituation, example, and a persuasive or inviting approach in a subtle way, by providing convincing good reasons and prospects (Abbas, 2021). In order to achieve success in shaping the personality of students so that their behavior patterns are always colored by religious values, it is necessary to have support from teachers and parents by providing good examples and examples. Through activities at school, for example, such as routine activities, spontaneous activities, exemplary and conditioning, this is a way to instill religious values in students in the school environment.\nRoutine activities are activities that are carried out daily at school, spontaneous activities are activities that are carried out suddenly or directly at that time, conditioning is a means of infrastructure that exists in schools, while exemplary is good behavior so that it deserves to be a role model in school. Through cultural activities in schools including routine activities, spontaneous exemplary and conditioning This education can be applied in schools (Hardiansyah, 2020).\nNational education functions to develop the ability and shape the character and civilization of a dignified nation in order to educate the nation's life, aiming to develop the potential of students to become human beings who have faith and devotion to God Almighty, have a noble character, healthy, knowledgeable, capable, creative, independent and become democratic and responsible citizens. The problem of epistemology in the development of Islamic education has become a polemic that has been passed down for generations from the time of Al-Ghazali until now. Religious science is the top priority, while general science is optional. However, the concept is widely misunderstood by some as a dichotomy of science.\nThe problem of dichotomy arises from the belief that religion and science come from different sources, religion comes directly from God, while science is nisbi. The starting point of religion is belief/faith, whereas science begins with doubt and distrust (Lutjito, 2010). To quote Albert Enstein's opinion :\"Religion without blind science, and science without religion is crippled\" Likewise with the opinion of Ki Hadjar Dewantara who stated that: \"Education is not only a practice of development but also goes hand in hand with struggle. Education means nurturing life growing towards progress, not to continue yesterday's situation according to yesterday's nature. Education is a cultural effort based on civility, namely advancing life in order to elevate the degree of humanity (Ki Hadjar Dewantara, 1992).\nWhereas according to Arnold J. Toynbee, historically religion came first and science grew out of religion (Toynbee, 1998). Explicitly, the Qur'an has mentioned in one of its verses that heaven and earth are two entities derived from the same entity. Whether you realize it or not, science is separated into two parts, namely \"Religious Science\" and \"General Science\". The dichotomy in this case eventually forces to believe in the existence of an educational system that is dualistic such as \" religious education\" and \"general education\". The fact that the history of Islam once gave birth to many world scientists such as Ibn Sina (medical expert), Al-Khawarizmi (mathematician), Ibn Khaldun (sociologist), As-shafi'i (jurist) and a series of other big names is indisputable evidence that Islamic values are the main drivers of the progress of science and science as the pillars that compose it (Hidayat, 2015). Such a view of dualism or scientific dichotomy must be corrected and straightened out, with concepts better capable of dialogue and integration between religion and other general sciences (Barbour, 2002).\nIn this problem, Islamic educational institutions need to rapprochment, in the sense of a willingness to accept each other's existence with chest space, leave a partition of the dividing wall between religion and science, want to approach each other, adjust to each other, dialogue, and even integrate between religious sciences and general sciences. The relationship between religion and the general sciences has always been an interesting discussion discourse. Science in human life is always evolving and changing. While religion has always been considered a hereditary tradition maintained by a particular society. Science and technology is currently achieving very rapid development, even as if it had never been predicted before.\nIn today's modern world, science is an incomparable gift of all time to human life in the face of all its demands and developments. And it is already a necessity of man who wants to achieve the progress and well-being of life, to master and utilize science as a prerequisite for his survival The rapid progress of science and technology as a result of the application of science seems to clearly provide pleasure for the outward life of man at large.\nMan has been able to exploit the riches of the world in a big way. The new problem with the rapid progress has emerged because it is not balanced with a strong and growing religion, and there is even a decline in religious life.\n\nMETHOD\nThis type of research is a field research, using qualitative descriptive methods (Sugiyono, 2013). The research method used is a quantitative research method.\nQuantitative research methods are one type of research whose specifications are systematic, planned and clearly structured from the beginning to the creation of the research design.\nAccording to (Sugiyono, 2017), quantitative research methods can be interpreted as research methods based on the philosophy of positivism, used to research certain populations or samples, sampling techniques are generally carried out randomly, data collection using research instruments, data analysis is quantitative / statistical, with the aim of testing predetermined hypotheses (Littlejohn, 2009).\n\nIntegrative Learning Model in Islamic Religious Education a. Definition\nIntegrative learning is a model of approach in learning that deliberately relates several aspects between integrated subjects . Integrative learning places more emphasis on actively engaging students in learning. This is in accordance with the expectations of the theory of constructivism which requires that students learn according to their experience. Learning according to this theory is a very personal painstaking effort, the teacher acts as a facilitator who convinces students to discover for themselves the principles and construct knowledge by solving realistic problems (Sunhaji, 2014).\n\nb. Learning Integration Models\nThere are 10 learning integration models, namely fragmented, conected, nested, sequenced, shared, webbed, threaded, integrated, immersed, and networked models. Of the 10 models can be described as follows:\n\n1) The Fragmented Model\nThis model is characterized by the characteristic of mixing which is limited to only one subject. The advantage of this model is that students fully master one particular ability for each subject, while the drawback is that students are less able to make integration relationships with similar concepts.\n\n2) The Conected Model\nThis model is based on the assumption that the points of learning can be attached to the parent of a particular subject. The advantage of this model is the presence of a relationship between ideas in one subject, the child will have a broader picture. Meanwhile, the drawback is that this model does not yet provide a comprehensive picture because it does not describe other subjects.\n3) The Nested Model . The nested model is the mixing of various forms of mastery of the concept of skills through a learning activity. The advantage of this model is that teachers can combine several skills in one subject, while the drawback is that without careful planning, some learning targets will become a priority intersection.\n\n4) The Sequenced Model\nThis model is a blending of topics between different subjects in parallel. The advantage is that it can prioritize curriculum priorities rather than following the order that the author makes in the textbook. The downside is that advanced collaboration is still needed to sort a subject by the current events.\n\n5) The Shared Model\nThis model is a blending of learning due to the overlapping of concepts or ideas in two or more subjects.\n\n6) The Wabbed Model\nThis model departs from a thematic approach as a blender of learning materials and activities. In this connection the theme can bind learning activities both in specific subjects, as well as across subjects. The advantage is that student motivation develops due to the selection of themes based on student interests. Meanwhile, the drawback is that many teachers find it difficult to choose a theme and even tend to provide a less in-depth theme in a subject.\n\n7) The Threaded Model\nIs a guiding model in the form of skills\n\n8) The Integrated Model\nIt is a guide to a number of different subject topics, but the essence is the same in a particular topic. The advantage of this model is that students relate to each other, connecting each other among various parts of the subject. In addition, this model can motivate students if its implementation is supported by a good environment. As for the shortcomings, this model is difficult to implement in full, requires high skills and confidence in the priority of the concept of a particular subject.\n\n9) The Emmersed Model\nThis model is designed to assist students in screening and blending various experiences and knowledge connected to the terrain of their use.\n\n10) The Networked Model\nIt is a learning guiding model that presupposes the possibility of changing conceptions, problem solving, and the demands of new forms of skills after students have conducted field studies in different situations and conditions and in different contexts.\n\nIntegrative Islamic Religious Education Materials\nSome examples of related learning, between general subjects and verses of the Qur'an which can be explicitly and explicitly applied or used as a reference in integrating Imtak and Another thing that allows Islamic Religious Education and Civics to be integrated is that Islamic religious education and Civics both fall into the category of character education .\nAccording to Doni Koesoema, character education is a social aid so that the individual can grow up in living his freedom in living with others or social beings. Character education also aims to shape each person into a person of priority. Slightly differently, Yudi Lathif defines character education as a term that promotes a learning process that supports personal development, including moral reasoning (cognitive) learning, social and emotional learning, moral virtue education and life skills education. Character education also works on various aspects of moral education, civics, and character development.\nCharacter education is thus a forum for students' learning in developing their individual character as well as their character when interacting with aspects of sociality from their community environment. Likewise, in character education, there are also individual and social spaces, each of which has a difference in pedagogical emphasis. As individuals, students certainly have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them from others, either in terms of their cognitive abilities or the experience of living religious values. However, in the differences in individual character, they are also introduced to other areas, where they live and interact socially, which gives the understanding that they are part of the members of the social community.\nTogether, Islamic education and civics need to also consider these two aspects (Individual and Social). Without considering these two aspects, the protégé will only fall into isolation (alinetion), which in the end will remove the true character of the protégé himself. They will lose their identity as individuals and their identity as a nation. That way, Islamic Religious Education still produces a person who obeys the passion of his Islamic faith, but also has insight and skills in plurality ethics as part of the Indonesian nation and state. On the other hand, civics will continue to provide students with a deep understanding of national insights with democratic values, human rights, and civil society, but furthermore also strengthen the passion of their faith. With this encouragement of religiosity, it is hoped that they will have an open perspective on the reality of plural nationality and this is where the urgency of integration between Islamic Religious Education and Civic Education in order to create an insight into multiculturalism for students. Studying the naqli postulate by reading, writing, translating the meaning of the verse and memorizing the verse, perhaps not very suit, but explaining and describing in a more detailed and slightly scientific aqliyah about matters relating to heaven, earth and anything that exists between the two is not easy, because it requires adequate insight into natural knowledge (naturak science). One of the sciences used to uncover the secrets of nature is physical science, which is one of the sciences that studies the behavior, nature, movement of change and the potential of nature. The above verse states that \"It was God who created the heavens and the earth and the things that lie in between\". Related to the verse, what circulates around the sun is an orderly nature whose dimensions are very large for human size. Between the earth and the sun is approximately 150 million km apart. This distance is very far for humans, but it is very small when compared to the distance between the sun and the most distant planet in the solar system.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIntegrative learning of Islamic Religious Education is to combine or integrate PAI teaching materials with materials and results of scientific research in various sciences such as physics, biology, sociology, and so on. This mixing is based on PAI material, then the results of scientific research are used as evidence of Islamic truth.\nPAI and science learning uses mixing or integrating with some of the integrative learning models mentioned above. Integrative learning provides a brief hint that innovation in PAI learning in schools needs to be carried out in order to respond to the development of society about its progress in the field of science and information technology. The direction and objectives of Islamic education that want to realize students who have early integrity and national loyalty therefore need to be accompanied by efforts to incentivize their scientific midwives. Some aspects of subjects in the scope of Islamic religious education that still need to get deep attention in order to stay on the axis of development of the times."

              "The crisis of modern man in the light of Masaryk’s national philosophy\n\nAbstract From the very beginnings of his thought, Thomas Garrigue Masaryk was convinced that modern man, and likewise the culturally and politically emancipated Czech nation, was in a deep existential crisis closely linked with the spread of irreligiosity. Masaryk gradually came to believe that this crisis could be positively overcome on two levels. On a theoretical level, he relied on his specific classification and systematization of the sciences. On a practical level, which was directly based on his notion of positive sciences and a strictly rational scientific approach, it was a matter of developing a new direction and method, which he characteristically conceived of as realism. On the eve of the First World War, Masaryk’s position became understandably radicalized. He distanced himself from a more objectivist view of religion and countered theism with a scientific and philosophical anthropism."

              "How Great Was the “Great Divide of Nature and Culture” in Europe? Philippe Descola’s Argument under Scrutinity\n\nIn his much-discussed work Beyond Nature and Culture, anthropologist Philippe Descola gives central importance to the “great divide” between nature and culture in European history. According to him, the “naturalism” created by this gap is at the heart of Western modernity and distinguishes it from the “others” on the planet. One can certainly agree with Descola that the nature-culture dualism cannot claim universal validity. However, the extent of the “great divide” created in Europe by early modern “rationalist” scholarship remains unclear. Methodologically, one should not limit oneself to the narrow history of science and philosophy, but also examine the linguistic, religious, and social history."

              "Religion and Postmodernism\n\nIn this article, I discuss the implications of postmodernism on religious thought, with special reference to Islamic thought. Firstly, I discuss the nature and characteristics of postmodernist thinking, and the different schools of thought/’postmodernisms’ that fall under that rubric. My contention is that postmodernism is a response to modernism rather than religion, although it has implications on religious thought. Secondly, I examine and compare the points of contention between modernism and post-modernism. I then argue that the differences are largely due to the privileging of nature and reasoning of modernists and the privileging of human/social and psychology of postmodernists. These, in turn, have implications on their metaphysics and epistemology, respectively. Thirdly, I provide an Islamic perspective on the modernist-postmodernist discourse, showing that the Islamic perspective transcends the natural-social divide, and how the tripartite relationship between God, man and nature, informs the discourse. The philosophy of language is also brought up in the discussion, where I suggest that Islam accepts the dual role of languages, that is, conveying the meaning in its literal sense (aka modernist), as well as being a symbol and an indirect reference (aka postmodernist). Finally, a close comparison is made between postmodernism and Islam, where both their incompatibilities as well as possible points of convergence are discussed."

              "The Role of Intellectual Islamic Heritage in the Discourse of Modern Islamic Philosophy\n\nThe article deals with the role of classical falsafa heritage in the modern Islamic philosophical discourse. Based on interpretations of texts of modern Islamic philosophers, the authors come to the conclusion about the relevance of the philosophical heritage of the past for the development of directions and methodologies of modern humanitarian knowledge. Conducting a comparative analysis of the doctrines of the Islamic Middle Ages and modern philosophers, the authors substantiate the commonality of approaches to the conceptualization of subjectivity, obligation, and existence. Modern Islamic philosophy is an experience of interaction between philosophy and theology. In Islamic philosophy, ethical questions were posed in connection with the discovery of moral consciousness in man. Human being, defined by moral sense, is understood by Islamic philosophers as a moral sensible being, in which a moral man and a moral society are formed. Exploring this issue, the authors have come to understand the integrity of modern Islamic philosophy, its interpretation as a philosophy of morality and moral philosophy."

              "A BRIEF COMPARISON BETWEEN SYSTEMATIC THEODICY AND THE QURANIC THEODICY\n\nOne of the most debated problems in the history of philosophy is the problem of evil. However, this issue is not only a problem of philosophy but also that of the religions which have a tradition of revelation. Religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam deal with this problem to some extent. Their instruments for answering this issue differ from philosophical explanations used the reasoning process intensely. Philosophers and theologians have tried to answer according to the religious tradition they belong to while offering some solutions to this problem. However, while giving these answers, they did not always take religious tradition into consideration, and they often tried to offer philosophical answers. In this paper, I tried to concentrate on some verses of the Qur'an that can be associated with the problem of evil and to show the relations between the concepts used in this context. Subsequently, I discussed whether some of the parables in the Qur’an can be evaluated within the framework of theodicy. Moreover, throughout this study, I tried to reveal the differences between the argument and style in the Qur'an and the philosophical theodicy also called systematic theodicy."

              "The Concept of Apokatastasis as a Symbol of Human Equality and Religious Inclusion\n\nThis article analyzes the notion of apokatastasis, first as it appears in the Greek philosophical tradition and then in the context of Christian thought. It shows how the cosmic theory of eternal return unfolded within early currents of Hellenic philosophy, and subsequently how the personal dimension of apokatastasis grew out of those traditions, where questions about the fate of humanity became primary. The article then points to the fundamental philosophical assumptions of apokatastasis in its cosmic and personal forms. Christian thought, in the process of its evolution, made significant use of Greek methodology and concepts. One of the theories transferred to the Christian context concerned the notion of universal salvation (apokatastasis). Such thinkers as Origen, Gregory of Nyssa and John Scotus Eriugena developed the concept into its mature form. Although apokatastasis has been condemned on numerous occasions, it has survived in Christian teaching. From a secular perspective, it can be regarded as a symbol of the equity of all people, beckoning us in the direction of the notion of religious inclusion. As such, it ought to be construed as translating into respect and care for the other person sic et nunc.  "

              ":The Right to Do Wrong: Morality and the Limits of Law\n\nHarvard University Press), 2019 Daniel Muñoz Forthcoming in Criminal Law and Philosophy Can our rights protect us even as we do terrible things, like wasting cash and voting for bad candidates? Jeremy Waldron says yes, on the grounds that rights would not truly protect our autonomy if they applied only to anodyne choices from permissible options, such as the choice between chocolate and vanilla ice cream.1 Waldron’s critics push back, contending that “rights to do wrong” are incoherent or inessential to autonomy. Given the title of Osiel’s book, I expected another salvo in this familiar debate, distinguished only by its extensive case studies. I was wrong. An understated, unexpected masterpiece, The Right to Do Wrong transcends the concept from which it takes its name to revitalize a classic conception of morality and law. It’s not Waldron with footnotes; it’s Montesquieu with social science. For Montesquieu, laws depend upon “the spirit of a nation.” For Osiel, that “spirit” is common morality—a community’s shared moral beliefs. Common morality forbids many things that American law does not: disinheriting children arbitrarily (56), shirking debts by filing for bankruptcy (49), collecting looted works of art (65), uttering hateful slurs (44), declining life-saving medical attention (91–8)—the list goes on and on. How should a society deal with such abuses of rights? We might roll back our rights; we could also accede to the abuses. (“They’re just exercising their rights,” after all.) Osiel shines a light on a third option. The abuse of rights can be limited by the threat"

Kanjeng Gusti Pangeran Adipati Arya Mangkunegara-I initiated the construction. The mosque belongs to Mangkunegaran palace and is protected as a cultural heritage building. The purpose of this research is to find 1). the historical value of the building, 2). various philosophical values that underlie the shape/embodiment of the structure (spatial planning, building form, decorative arts), 3). contextual matters related to the function and condition of the Al-Wustho Mangkunegaran Mosque. The methods used are 1. historical plot tracing, building artifacts tracing through primary and secondary sources, 2. Interviews with mosque/marbot holders, community users, and community leaders. 3. Reference studies, analysis, and synthesis. The historical values are indicated by the existence of the palace mosque which is a cultural heritage building. The King besides being a ruler is also a religious leader (panatagama). The philosophical values are reflected in the design, construction, symbols, and ornamentation of mosques that contain Islamic philosophy. Located on a three-stack tajug roof, calligraphic ornamentation on gates, doors, windows, and columns is a reminder to be closer to Allah. The contextual values of the building are seen in the blending style of Javanese, European and Islamic cultures. The mosque also functions for the benefit of the people as the embodiment of rahmatan lil Alamin."

              "The Philosophy of Antiphilosophy in Islam\n\nIn this article, I will examine Aristotle’s protreptic argument for the necessity of philosophy as it was deployed by Al-Kindi. I will show how a Muslim critic of philosophy, primarily one who is aligned with the theological outlook of Ibn Hanbal, can reasonably reject the protreptic argument as Al-Kindi presents it. The argument can, however, be reworked in a way to circumvent common criticisms of it presented by Hanbalī-style opponents of philosophy. Indeed, I will argue that, once the argument is properly clarified with reference to what constitutes ‘philosophy’, its soundness is incontrovertible. In closing, I will briefly discuss why Muslim critics of philosophy need not see the protreptic argument as threatening, as the inevitability of philosophy does not necessitate a commitment to all sorts of philosophical positions, however problematic these may be for Islamic doctrine."

              "How the monopoly of “scientific atheism” in Soviet social science was ruined\n\nAs an integral part of Marxism-Leninism, scientific atheism was being protected fromcriticism with the help of an information blockade. Teaching its basics (from 1959) in higher education institutions formed such a theoretical attitude to religion, which practically excluded from the socio-cultural and scientific space any full-fledged knowledge about religion, religious institutions, religious figures and thinkers. But if atheism in the USSR was planted using the full power of ideological services and the entire system of higher education of the country, then resistance to it was an individual matter. And it remained so throughout the entire Soviet period. Realizing the negative attitude of society towards the anti-religious and anti-church campaigns, Soviet leaders stopped to destruct churches. Shortly after the fall of N. Khrushchev, the All-Russian Society for the Protection of Historical and Cultural Monuments (VOOPiK) was created, which began to be legal opposition to anti-church policy. Since the late 60s , religious samizdat has begun to develop. Our article is devoted to two special cases from the history of destruction in the scientific space of the information blockade on religious and ecclesiastical matters. This blockade breakthrough was carried out by employees of two major Soviet ideological institutes: the editorial office of the Philosophical Encyclopedia and the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences of the USSR Academy of Sciences (INION of the USSR Academy of Sciences). Preparation of The Philosophical Encyclopedia started during the years of the anti-religious and anti-church campaign. It seemed that the situation itself excluded any resistance to the ideological policy of the CPSU. But it was in this edition that the young philosophers, led by Renata Galtseva, with their articles on Russian religious philosophy, dealt a tangible blow to the monopoly of scientific atheism. The second blow was inflicted by INION employees with their abstract collections. They managed to show what role religion and churches have played and continue to play in people's lives, in socialist countries including. The author was a contemporary, and in some cases a participant in the events described in the article."

              "K.D. Balmont and the Culture of Islam\n\n\n The purpose of our research is the work of the great symbolist poet of the Silver Age K.D. Balmont through the prism of the culture of Islam. The topic of the culture of Islam in the poet's work has been little studied, which is the relevance of this study. Islam is a traditional religion and the cultural and spiritual life of a Muslim is inextricably linked with Islam. All literature, architecture, science, philosophy of Muslims is based on the teachings of Islam and its holy book the Koran. K.D. Balmont became interested in Arabic and translations of the Koran, melodic Arabic script. Subsequently, his essays, poems and travel notes will be filled with religious and cultural images. The methodology of the work is based on synchronic, structural and functional, biographical, historical and cultural methods. The novelty of the article lies in a new look at the work of K.D. Balmont within the framework of the culture of Islam. In the course of our work, we examined Balmont's religious poems of 12 suras: \"I swear\", \"Merciful\", \"Great News\", \"Blow\", \"Oh, Prophet\", \"Rich People\", \"Trumpet sound\", \"Then\", \"Smoke\", \"Al-Hotama\", \"Event\", \"Don't forget.\" There were also many translations from Arabic, travel notes, essays, and the epistolary legacy of Balmont. The poet traveled a lot and visited Muslim countries, made translations from Arabic, wrote essays and travel notes about the culture of Islam. As a result, the main conclusions of the study were formulated, the culture of Islam was shown, the religious poems of K.D. Balmont were studied, and further prospects for studying this problem were outlined.\n"

              "Christian view on treating animals: theological criticism of P. Singer\n\nP. Singer is called one of the most influential living philosophers in the world, and one of the most controversial. The author of \"Animal Liberation\", \"Practical Ethics\", \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\" created his own project of preference utilitarianism, in which he placed animals as moral subjects equal to man. In this, he questions Christian anthropocentrism: a human in his system of ethics is intrinsically no better than a chimpanzee or a dog. He recognizes the uniqueness of all species, speaking out against speciesism (discrimination on grounds of species). Singer's ethics is completely independent of religion. Raising issues related to abortion, euthanasia, animal rights, etc., the philosopher inevitably arrived to confrontation with Christian ethics and religious worldview in general. Religion, especially Christianity, plays a significant role in his works, since he considers many of the provisions of Christianity: the special position of humans in the natural world, the attitude to the sanctity of life - to be morally problematic. The article analyzes Peter Singer's critical theses on the Christian religion, including Christian ethics. The second section considers the responses of a number of modern religious thinkers to Singer's criticism of Christianity. In conclusion, the arguments of both sides are analyzed, their strengths and weaknesses are outlined, involving a broader tradition of secular-religious dispute. Conclusions are made about the validity of P. Singer's criticism of religion. Although said criticism is broadly integrated into the works of the philosopher, it is hardly a focus point - rather a tool to solidify Singer's position on practical questions like abortion, euthanasia, animal rights, etc. The negative attitude to religion has roots in Singer's early acquaintance with the Bible and the unhappy past of his family (two of the philosopher's grandparents died in concentration camps). The question of the meaninglessness of suffering largely determines the philosophy and practical ethics of P. Singer. Arguing with theologians, he most often resorts to the classical argument from evil. Singer's criticism of Christian religion is limited, reduced to the problem of the meaninglessness of suffering, the Euthyphron dilemma, criticism of the sanctity of human life, the \"dominion\" of man over nature. With the exception of a detailed analysis of the bias of Christianity against animals, the criticism is not original."
